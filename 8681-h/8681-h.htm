    <h2>
      THE WOMAN OF STONE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lurine, was pretty, <i>petite</i>, and eighteen. She had a nice situation
      at the Pharmacie de Siam, in the Rue St. Honoré. She had no one dependent
      upon her, and all the money she earned was her own. Her dress was of cheap
      material perhaps, but it was cut and fitted with that daintiness of
      perfection which seems to be the natural gift of the Parisienne, so that
      one never thought of the cheapness, but admired only the effect, which was
      charming. She was book-keeper and general assistant at the Pharmacie, and
      had a little room of her own across the Seine, in the Rue de Lille. She
      crossed the river twice every day&mdash;once in the morning when the sun
      was shining, and again at night when the radiant lights along the river&rsquo;s
      bank glittered like jewels in a long necklace. She had her little walk
      through the Gardens of the Tuileries every morning after crossing the Pont
      Royal, but she did not return through the gardens in the evening, for a
      park in the morning is a different thing to a park at night. On her return
      she always walked along the Rue de Tuileries until she came to the bridge.
      Her morning ramble through the gardens was a daily delight to her, for the
      Rue de Lille is narrow, and not particularly bright, so it was pleasant to
      walk beneath the green trees, to feel the crisp gravel under her feet, and
      to see the gleaming white statues in the sunlight, with the sparkle on the
      round fountain pond, by the side of which she sometimes sat. Her favorite
      statue was one of a woman that stood on a pedestal near the Rue de Rivoli.
      The arm was thrown over her head, and there was a smile on the marble face
      which was inscrutable. It fascinated the girl as she looked up to it, and
      seemed to be the morning greeting to her busy day&rsquo;s work in the
      city. If no one was in sight, which was often the case at eight o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, the girl kissed the tips of her fingers, and tossed the
      salute airily up to the statue, and the woman of stone always smiled back
      at her the strange mystical smile which seemed to indicate that it knew
      much more of this world and its ways than did the little Parisienne who
      daily gazed up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lurine was happy, as a matter of course, for was not Paris always
      beautiful? Did not the sun shine brightly? And was not the air always
      clear? What more, then, could a young girl wish? There was one thing which
      was perhaps lacking, but that at last was supplied; and then there was not
      a happier girl in all Paris than Lurine. She almost cried it aloud to her
      favorite statue the next morning, for it seemed to her that the smile had
      broadened since she had passed it the morning before, and she felt as if
      the woman of stone had guessed the secret of the woman of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lurine had noticed him for several days hovering about the Pharmacie, and
      looking in at her now and then; she saw it all, but pretended not to see.
      He was a handsome young fellow with curly hair, and hands long, slender,
      and white as if he were not accustomed to doing hard, manual labor. One
      night he followed her as far as the bridge, but she walked rapidly on, and
      he did not overtake her. He never entered the Pharmacie, but lingered
      about as if waiting for a chance to speak with her. Lurine had no one to
      confide in but the woman of stone, and it seemed by her smile that she
      understood already, and there was no need to tell her, that the inevitable
      young man had come. The next night he followed her quite across the
      bridge, and this time Lurine did not walk so quickly. Girls in her
      position are not supposed to have normal introductions to their lovers,
      and are generally dependent upon a haphazard acquaintance, although that
      Lurine did not know. The young man spoke to her on the bridge, raising his
      hat from his black head as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; was all he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced sideways shyly at him, but did not answer, and the young man
      walked on beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come this way every night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been
      watching you. Are you offended?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then may I walk with you to your home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may walk with me as far as the corner of the Rue de Lille,&rdquo;
      she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said the young fellow, and together they walked
      the short distance, and there he bade her good night, after asking
      permission to meet her at the corner of the Rue St. Honoré, and walk home
      with her, the next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not come to the shop,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he replied, nodding his head in assent to her
      wishes. He told her his name was Jean Duret, and by-and-by she called him
      Jean, and he called her Lurine. He never haunted the Pharmacie now, but
      waited for her at the corner, and one Sunday he took her for a little
      excursion on the river, which she enjoyed exceedingly. Thus time went on,
      and Lurine was very happy. The statue smiled its enigmatical smile,
      though, when the sky was overcast, there seemed to her a subtle warning in
      the smile. Perhaps it was because they had quarrelled the night before.
      Jean had seemed to her harsh and unforgiving. He had asked her if she
      could not bring him some things from the Pharmacie, and gave her a list of
      three chemicals, the names of which he had written on a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can easily get them,&rdquo; he had said; &ldquo;they are in
      every Pharmacie, and will never be missed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the girl in horror, &ldquo;that would be stealing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do they pay you there?&rdquo; he asked. And when she told
      him, he laughed again and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless you, if I got so little as that I would take something
      from the shelves every day and sell it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him in amazement, and he, angry at her, turned upon his
      heel and left her. She leaned her arms upon the parapet of the bridge, and
      looked down into the dark water. The river always fascinated her at night,
      and she often paused to look at it when crossing the bridge, shuddering as
      she did so. She cried a little as she thought of his abrupt departure, and
      wondered if she had been too harsh with him. After all, it was not very
      much he had asked her to do, and they did pay her so little at the
      Pharmacie. And then perhaps her lover was poor, and needed the articles he
      had asked her to get. Perhaps he was ill, and had said nothing. There was
      a touch on her shoulder. She looked round. Jean was standing beside her,
      but the frown had not yet disappeared from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that paper,&rdquo; he said, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She unclosed her hand, and he picked the paper from it, and was turning
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will get you what you want, but I
      will myself put the money in the till for what they cost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, looking at her for a moment, and then said&mdash;&ldquo;Lurine,
      I think you are a little fool. They owe you ever so much more than that.
      However, I must have the things,&rdquo; and he gave her back the paper
      with the caution&mdash;&ldquo;Be sure you let no one see that, and be very
      certain that you get the right things.&rdquo; He walked with her as far as
      the corner of the Rue de Lille. &ldquo;You are not angry with me?&rdquo;
      he asked her before they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do anything for you,&rdquo; she whispered, and then he
      kissed her good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got the chemicals when the proprietor was out, and tied them up
      neatly, as was her habit, afterwards concealing them in the little basket
      in which she carried her lunch. The proprietor was a sharp-eyed old lynx,
      who looked well after his shop and his pretty little assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been getting so much chlorate of potash?&rdquo; he asked,
      taking down the jar, and looking sharply at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here is the money in the
      till.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did not expect you to give it
      away for nothing. Who bought it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old man,&rdquo; replied the girl, trembling still, but the
      proprietor did not notice that&mdash;he was counting the money, and found
      it right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering what he wanted with so much of it. If he comes in
      again look sharply at him, and be able to describe him to me. It seems
      suspicious.&rdquo; Why it seemed suspicious Lurine did not know, but she
      passed an anxious time until she took the basket in her hand and went to
      meet her lover at the corner of the Rue des Pyramides. His first question
      was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you brought me the things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Will you take them here, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here, not here,&rdquo; he replied hurriedly, and then asked
      anxiously, &ldquo;Did anyone see you take them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the proprietor knows of the large package, for he counted
      the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What money?&rdquo; asked Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the money for the things. You didn&rsquo;t think I was going
      to steal them, did you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed, and drew her into a quiet corner of the Gardens of
      the Tuileries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not have time to go with you to the Rue de Lille to-night,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will come as usual to-morrow night?&rdquo; she asked,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly.&rdquo; he replied, as he rapidly concealed
      the packages in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night the girl waited patiently for her lover at the corner where
      they were in the habit of meeting, but he did not come. She stood under
      the glaring light of a lamp-post so that he would recognize her at once.
      Many people accosted her as she stood there, but she answered none,
      looking straight before her with clear honest eyes, and they passed on
      after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. At last she saw a man running rapidly
      down the street, and as he passed a brilliantly-lighted window she
      recognized Jean. He came quickly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; she cried, running forward. She caught him by the
      arm, saying, &ldquo;Oh, Jean, what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook her rudely, and shouted at her&mdash;&ldquo;Let me go, you fool!&rdquo;
      But she clung to him, until he raised his fist and struck her squarely in
      the face. Lurine staggered against the wall, and Jean ran on. A stalwart
      man who had spoken to Lurine a few moments before, and, not understanding
      her silence, stood in a doorway near watching her, sprang out when he saw
      the assault, and thrust his stick between the feet of the flying man,
      flinging him face forward on the pavement. The next instant he placed his
      foot upon Jean&rsquo;s neck holding him down as if he were a snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Strike a woman, would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean lay there as if stunned, and two gens d&rsquo;armes came pantingly
      upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This scoundrel,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;has just assaulted a
      woman. I saw him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done more than that,&rdquo; said one of the officers,
      grimly, as if, after all, the striking of a woman was but a trivial
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They secured the young man, and dragged him with them. The girl came up to
      them and said, falteringly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all a mistake, it was an accident. He didn&rsquo;t mean to do
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he didn&rsquo;t, and pray how do you know?&rdquo; asked one of
      the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little devil,&rdquo; said Jean to the girl, through his
      clinched teeth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all your fault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers hurried him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;that we should have arrested the
      girl; you heard what she said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but we have enough on our hands
      now, if the crowd find out who he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lurine thought of following them, but she was so stunned by the words that
      her lover had said to her, rather than by the blow he had given her that
      she turned her steps sadly towards the Pont Royal and went to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she did not go through the gardens, as usual, to her
      work, and when she entered the Pharmacie de Siam, the proprietor cried
      out, &ldquo;Here she is, the vixen! Who would have thought it of her? You
      wretch, you stole my drugs to give to that villain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Lurine, stoutly. &ldquo;I put the money in
      the till for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear her! She confesses!&rdquo; said the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two concealed officers stepped forward and arrested her where she
      stood as the accomplice of Jean Duret, who, the night before, had flung a
      bomb in the crowded Avenue de l&rsquo;Opéra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the prejudiced French judges soon saw that the girl was innocent of
      all evil intent, and was but the victim of the scoundrel who passed by the
      name of Jean Duret. He was sentenced for life; she was set free. He had
      tried to place the blame on her, like the craven he was, to shield another
      woman. This was what cut Lurine to the heart. She might have tried to find
      an excuse for his crime, but she realized that he had never cared for her,
      and had but used her as his tool to get possession of the chemicals he
      dared not buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drizzling rain she walked away from her prison, penniless, and
      broken in body and in spirit. She passed the little Pharmacie de Siam, not
      daring to enter. She walked in the rain along the Rue des Pyramides, and
      across the Rue de Rivoli, and into the Tuileries Gardens. She had
      forgotten about her stone woman, but, unconsciously her steps were
      directed to her. She looked up at her statue with amazement, at first not
      recognizing it. It was no longer the statue of a smiling woman. The head
      was thrown back, the eyes closed. The last mortal agony was on the face.
      It was a ghastly monument to Death. The girl was so perplexed by the
      change in her statue that for the moment she forgot the ruin of her own
      life. She saw that the smiling face was but a mask, held in place by the
      curving of the left arm over it. Life, she realized now, was made up of
      tragedy and comedy, and he who sees but the smiling face, sees but the
      half of life. The girl hurried on to the bridge, sobbing quietly to
      herself, and looked down at the grey river water. The passers-by paid no
      attention to her. Why, she wondered, had she ever thought the river cold
      and cruel and merciless? It is the only home of the homeless, the only
      lover that does not change. She turned back to the top of the flight of
      steps which lead down, to the water&rsquo;s brink. She looked toward the
      Tuileries Gardens, but she could not see her statue for the trees which
      intervened. &ldquo;I, too, will be a woman of stone,&rdquo; she said, as
      she swiftly descended the steps.

    <h2>
      THE CHEMISTRY OF ANARCHY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It has been said in the London papers that the dissolution of the Soho
      Anarchist League was caused by want of funds. This is very far from being
      the case. An Anarchist League has no need for funds and so long as there
      is money enough to buy beer the League is sure of continued existence. The
      truth about the scattering of the Soho organization was told me by a young
      newspaper-man who was chairman at the last meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was not an anarchist, though he had to pretend to be one in
      the interests of his paper, and so joined the Soho League, where he made
      some fiery speeches that were much applauded. At last Anarchist news
      became a drug in the market, and the editor of the paper young Marshall
      Simkins belonged to, told him that he would now have to turn his attention
      to Parliamentary work, as he would print no more Anarchist news in the
      sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might think that young Simkins would have been glad to get rid of his
      anarchist work, as he had no love for the cause. He was glad to get rid of
      it, but he found some difficulty in sending in his resignation. The moment
      he spoke of resigning, the members became suspicious of him. He had always
      been rather better dressed than the others, and, besides, he drank less
      beer. If a man wishes to be in good standing in the League he must not be
      fastidious as to dress, and he must be constructed to hold at least a
      gallon of beer at a sitting. Simkins was merely a &ldquo;quart&rdquo; man,
      and this would have told against him all along if it had not been for the
      extra gunpowder he put in his speeches. On several occasions seasoned
      Anarchists had gathered about him and begged him to give up his designs on
      the Parliament buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older heads claimed that, desirable as was the obliteration of the
      Houses of Parliament, the time was not yet ripe for it. England, they
      pointed out, was the only place where Anarchists could live and talk
      unmolested, so, while they were quite anxious that Simkins should go and
      blow up Vienna, Berlin, or Paris, they were not willing for him to begin
      on London. Simkins was usually calmed down with much difficulty, and
      finally, after hissing &ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; two or three times under his
      breath, he concluded with, &ldquo;Oh, very well, then, you know better
      than I do&mdash;I am only a young recruit; but allow me at least to blow
      up Waterloo Bridge, or spring a bomb in Fleet Street just to show that we
      are up and doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But this the Anarchists would not sanction. If he wanted to blow up
      bridges, he could try his hand on those across the Seine. They had given
      their word that there would be no explosions in London so long as England
      afforded them an asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at Trafalgar Square,&rdquo; cried Simkins angrily; &ldquo;we
      are not allowed to meet there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wants to meet there?&rdquo; said the chairman. &ldquo;It is
      ever so much more comfortable in these rooms, and there is no beer in
      Trafalgar Square.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; put in several others;
      &ldquo;the time is not yet ripe for it.&rdquo; Thus was Simkins calmed
      down, and beer allowed to flow again in tranquillity, while some foreign
      Anarchist, who was not allowed to set foot in his native country, would
      get up and harangue the crowd in broken English and tell them what great
      things would yet be done by dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Simkins sent in his resignation a change came over their feelings
      towards him, and he saw at once that he was a marked man. The chairman, in
      a whisper, advised him to withdraw his resignation. So Simkins, who was a
      shrewd young fellow, understanding the temper of the assembly, arose and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire to resign, but you do nothing except talk, and I
      want to belong to an Anarchist Society that acts.&rdquo; He stayed away
      from the next meeting, and tried to drop them in that way, but a committee
      from the League called upon him at his lodgings, and his landlady thought
      that young Simkins had got into bad ways when he had such evil-looking men
      visiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simkins was in a dilemma, and could not make up his mind what to do. The
      Anarchists apparently were not to be shaken off. He applied to his editor
      for advice on the situation, but that good man could think of no way out
      of the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have known better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than to mix
      up with such people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was I to get the news?&rdquo; asked Simkins, with some
      indignation. The editor shrugged his shoulders. That was not his part of
      the business; and if the Anarchists chose to make things uncomfortable for
      the young man, he could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simkins&rsquo; fellow-lodger, a student who was studying chemistry in
      London, noticed that the reporter was becoming gaunt with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simkins,&rdquo; said Sedlitz to him one morning, &ldquo;you are
      haggard and careworn: what is the matter with you? Are you in love, or is
      it merely debt that is bothering you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; replied Simkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then cheer up,&rdquo; said Sedlitz. &ldquo;If one or the other is
      not interfering with you, anything else is easily remedied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; rejoined Simkins; and then he sat
      down and told his friend just what was troubling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sedlitz, &ldquo;that accounts for it. There has
      been an unkempt ruffian marching up and down watching this house. They are
      on your track, Simkins, my boy, and when they discover that you are a
      reporter, and therefore necessarily a traitor, you will be nabbed some
      dark night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s encouraging,&rdquo; said Simkins, with his head
      in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these Anarchists brave men, and would they risk their lives in
      any undertaking?&rdquo; asked Sedlitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. They talk enough, but I don&rsquo;t know
      what they would do. They are quite capable, though, of tripping me up in a
      dark lane.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Sedlitz, &ldquo;suppose you let me try a
      plan. Let me give them a lecture on the Chemistry of Anarchy. It&rsquo;s a
      fascinating subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wait till you have heard the lecture. If I don&rsquo;t make the
      hair of some of them stand on end, they are braver men than I take them to
      be. We have a large room in Clement&rsquo;s Inn, where we students meet to
      try experiments and smoke tobacco. It is half club, and half a lecture-
      room. Now, I propose to get those Anarchists in there, lock the doors, and
      tell them something about dynamite and other explosives. You give out that
      I am an Anarchist from America. Tell them that the doors will be locked to
      prevent police interference, and that there will be a barrel of beer. You
      can introduce me as a man from America, where they know as much about
      Anarchism in ten minutes as they do here in ten years. Tell them that I
      have spent my life in the study of explosives. I will have to make-up a
      little, but you know that I am a very good amateur actor, and I don&rsquo;t
      think there will be any trouble about that. At the last you must tell them
      that you have an appointment and will leave me to amuse them for a couple
      of hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what good it is all going to do, though I am
      desperate,&rdquo; said Simkins, &ldquo;and willing to try anything. I have
      thought some of firing a bomb off myself at an Anarchist meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Friday night of meeting arrived the large hall in Clement&rsquo;s
      Inn was filled to the doors. Those assembled there saw a platform at one
      end of the apartment, and a door that led from it to a room at the back of
      the hall. A table was on the platform, and boxes, chemical apparatus, and
      other scientific-looking paraphernalia were on it. At the hour of eight
      young Simkins appeared before the table alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow Anarchists,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are well aware that I
      am tired of the great amount of talk we indulge in, and the little action
      which follows it. I have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation
      of an Anarchist from America, who will tell you something of the cause
      there. We have had the doors locked, and those who keep the keys are now
      down at the entrance of the Inn, so that if a fire should occur, they can
      quickly come and let us out. There is no great danger of fire, however,
      but the interruption of the police must be guarded against very carefully.
      The windows, as you see, are shuttered and barred, and no ray of light can
      penetrate from this room outside. Until the lecture is over no one can
      leave the room, and by the same token no one can enter it, which is more
      to the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, Professor Josiah P. Slivers, has devoted his life to the
      Chemistry of Anarchy, which is the title of this lecture. He will tell you
      of some important discoveries, which are now to be made known for the
      first time. I regret to say that the Professor is not in a very good state
      of health, because the line of life which he has adopted has its
      drawbacks. His left eye has been blown away by a premature explosion
      during his experiments. His right leg is also permanently disabled. His
      left arm, as you will notice, is in a sling, having been injured by a
      little disaster in his workshop since he came to London. He is a man, as
      you will see, devoted body and soul to the cause, so I hope you will
      listen to him attentively. I regret that I am unable to remain with you
      to-night, having other duties to perform which are imperative. I will
      therefore, if you will permit me, leave by the back entrance after I have
      introduced the Professor to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the stumping of a wooden leg was heard, and those in the
      audience saw appear a man on crutches, with one arm in a sling and a
      bandage over an eye, although he beamed upon them benevolently with the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow Anarchists,&rdquo; said Simkins, &ldquo;allow me to
      introduce to you Professor Josiah P. Slivers, of the United States.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor bowed and the audience applauded. As soon as the applause
      began the Professor held up his unmaimed arm and said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, I
      beg that you will not applaud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems the fashion in America to address a11 sorts and conditions of men
      as &ldquo;Gentlemen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor continued, &ldquo;I have here some explosives so sensitive
      that the slightest vibration will cause them to go off, and I therefore
      ask you to listen in silence to what I have to say. I must particularly
      ask you also not to stamp on the floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before these remarks were concluded Simkins had slipped out by the back
      entrance, and somehow his desertion seemed to have a depressing effect
      upon the company, who looked upon the broken-up Professor with eyes of
      wonder and apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew towards him one of the boxes and opened the lid. He
      dipped his one useful hand into the box and, holding it aloft, allowed
      something which looked like wet sawdust to drip through his fingers.
      &ldquo;That, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with an air of the utmost
      contempt, &ldquo;is what is known to the world as dynamite. I have nothing
      at all to say against dynamite. It has, in its day, been a very powerful
      medium through which our opinions have been imparted to a listening world,
      but its day is past. It is what the lumbering stage-coach is to the
      locomotive, what the letter is to the telegram, what the sailing-vessel is
      to the steamship. It will be my pleasant duty to-night to exhibit to you
      an explosive so powerful and deadly that hereafter, having seen what it
      can accomplish, you will have nothing but derision for such simple and
      harmless compounds as dynamite and nitro-glycerine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor looked with kindly sympathy over his audience as he allowed
      the yellow mixture to percolate slowly through his fingers back into the
      box again. Ever and anon he took up a fresh handful and repeated the
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Anarchists in the audience exchanged uneasy glances one with the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; continued the Professor, &ldquo;it will be useful for
      us to consider this substance for a few moments, if but for the purpose of
      comparison. Here,&rdquo; he said, diving his hand into another box and
      bringing up before their gaze a yellow brick, &ldquo;is dynamite in a
      compressed form. There is enough here to wreck all this part of London,
      were it exploded. This simple brick would lay St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
      in ruins, so, however antiquated dynamite may become, we must always look
      upon it with respect, just as we look upon reformers of centuries ago who
      perished for their opinions, even though their opinions were far behind
      what ours are now. I shall take the liberty of performing some experiments
      with this block of dynamite.&rdquo; Saying which the Professor, with his
      free arm, flung the block of dynamite far down the aisle, where it fell on
      the floor with a sickening thud. The audience sprang from their seats and
      tumbled back one over the other. A wild shriek went up into the air, but
      the Professor gazed placidly on the troubled mob below him with a superior
      smile on his face. &ldquo;I beg you to seat yourselves,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and for reasons which I have already explained, I trust that you
      will not applaud any of my remarks. You have just now portrayed one of the
      popular superstitions about dynamite, and you show by your actions how
      necessary a lecture of this sort is in order that you may comprehend
      thoroughly the substance with which you have to deal. That brick is
      perfectly harmless, because it is frozen. Dynamite in its frozen state
      will not explode&mdash;a fact well understood by miners and all those who
      have to work with it, and who, as a rule, generally prefer to blow
      themselves to pieces trying to thaw the substance before a fire. Will you
      kindly bring that brick back to me, before it thaws out in the heated
      atmosphere of this room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men stepped gingerly forward and picked up the brick, holding
      it far from his body, as he tip-toed up to the platform, where he laid it
      down carefully on the desk before the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Professor, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man drew a long breath of relief as he went back to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is frozen dynamite,&rdquo; continued the Professor, &ldquo;and
      is, as I have said, practically harmless. Now, it will be my pleasure to
      perform two startling experiments with the unfrozen substance,&rdquo; and
      with that he picked up a handful of the wet sawdust and flung it on a
      small iron anvil that stood on the table. &ldquo;You will enjoy these
      experiments,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because it will show you with what
      ease dynamite may be handled. It is a popular error that concussion will
      cause dynamite to explode. There is enough dynamite here to blow up this
      hall and to send into oblivion every person in it, yet you will see
      whether or not concussion will explode it.&rdquo; The Professor seized a
      hammer and struck the substance on the anvil two or three sharp blows,
      while those in front of him scrambled wildly back over their comrades,
      with hair standing on end. The Professor ceased his pounding and gazed
      reproachfully at them; then something on the anvil appeared to catch his
      eye. He bent over it and looked critically on the surface of the iron.
      Drawing himself up to his full height again, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to reproach you for what might have appeared to any
      other man as evidence of fear, but I see my mistake. I came very near
      making a disastrous error. I have myself suffered from time to time from
      similar errors. I notice upon the anvil a small spot of grease; if my
      hammer had happened to strike that spot you would all now be writhing in
      your death-agonies under the ruins of this building. Nevertheless, the
      lesson is not without its value. That spot of grease is free nitro-
      glycerine that has oozed out from the dynamite. Therein rests, perhaps,
      the only danger in handling dynamite. As I have shown you, you can smash
      up dynamite on an anvil without danger, but if a hammer happened to strike
      a spot of free nitroglycerine it would explode in a moment. I beg to
      apologize to you for my momentary neglect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A man rose up in the middle of the hall, and it was some little time
      before he could command voice enough to speak, for he was shaking as if
      from palsy. At last he said, after he had moistened his lips several
      times:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor, we are quite willing to take your word about the
      explosive. I think I speak for all my comrades here. We have no doubt at
      all about your learning, and would much prefer to hear from your own lips
      what you have to say on the subject, and not have you waste any more
      valuable time with experiments. I have not consulted with my comrades
      before speaking, but I think I voice the sense of the meeting.&rdquo;
      Cries of &ldquo;You do, you do,&rdquo; came from all parts of the hall.
      The Professor once more beamed upon them benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your confidence in me is indeed touching,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      a chemical lecture without experiments is like a body without a soul.
      Experiment is the soul of research. In chemistry we must take nothing for
      granted. I have shown you how many popular errors have arisen regarding
      the substance with which we are dealing. It would have been impossible for
      these errors to have arisen if every man had experimented for himself; and
      although I thank you for the mark of confidence you have bestowed upon me,
      I cannot bring myself to deprive you of the pleasure which my experiments
      will afford you. There is another very common error to the effect that
      fire will explode dynamite. Such, gentlemen, is not the case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor struck a match on his trousers-leg and lighted the substance
      on the anvil. It burnt with a pale bluish flame, and the Professor gazed
      around triumphantly at his fellow Anarchists.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the shuddering audience watched with intense fascination the pale
      blue flame the Professor suddenly stooped over and blew it out.
      Straightening himself once more he said, &ldquo;Again I must apologize to
      you, for again I have forgotten the small spot of grease. If the flame had
      reached the spot of nitro-glycerine it would have exploded, as you all
      know. When a man has his thoughts concentrated on one subject he is apt to
      forget something else. I shall make no more experiments with dynamite.
      Here, John,&rdquo; he said to the trembling attendant, &ldquo;take this
      box away, and move it carefully, for I see that the nitro-glycerine is
      oozing out. Put it as tenderly down in the next room as if it were a box
      of eggs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the box disappeared there was a simultaneous long-drawn sigh of relief
      from the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;we come to the
      subject that ought to occupy the minds of all thoughtful men.&rdquo; He
      smoothed his hair complacently with the palm of his practicable hand, and
      smiled genially around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The substance that I am about to tell you of is my own invention,
      and compares with dynamite as prussic acid does with new milk as a
      beverage.&rdquo; The Professor dipped his fingers in his vest pocket and
      drew out what looked like a box of pills. Taking one pill out he placed it
      upon the anvil and as he tip-toed back he smiled on it with a smile of
      infinite tenderness. &ldquo;Before I begin on this subject I want to warn
      you once more that if any man as much as stamps upon the floor, or moves
      about except on tip-toe this substance will explode and will lay London
      from here to Charing Cross in one mass of indistinguishable ruins. I have
      spent ten years of my life in completing this invention. And these pills,
      worth a million a box, will cure all ills to which the flesh is heir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; he said, turning to his attendant, &ldquo;bring me a
      basin of water!&rdquo; The basin of water was placed gingerly upon the
      table, and the Professor emptied all the pills into it, picking up also
      the one that was on the anvil and putting it with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;we can breathe
      easier. A man can put one of these pills in a little vial of water, place
      the vial in his vest-pocket, go to Trafalgar Square, take the pill from
      the vial, throw it in the middle of the Square, and it will shatter
      everything within the four-mile radius, he himself having the glorious
      privilege of suffering instant martyrdom for the cause. People have told
      me that this is a drawback to my invention, but I am inclined to differ
      with them. The one who uses this must make up his mind to share the fate
      of those around him. I claim that this is the crowning glory of my
      invention. It puts to instant test our interest in the great cause. John,
      bring in very carefully that machine with the electric-wire attachment
      from the next room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The machine was placed upon the table. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the
      Professor, holding up some invisible object between his thumb and
      forefinger, &ldquo;is the finest cambric needle. I will take upon the
      point of it an invisible portion of the substance I speak of.&rdquo; Here
      he carefully picked out a pill from the basin, and as carefully placed it
      upon the table, where he detached an infinitesimal atom of it and held it
      up on the point of the needle. &ldquo;This particle,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;is so small that it cannot be seen except with the aid of a
      microscope. I will now place needle and all on the machine and touch it
      off with electric current;&rdquo; and as his hand hovered over the
      push-button there were cries of &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; but the finger
      descended, and instantly there was a terrific explosion. The very
      foundation seemed shaken, and a dense cloud of smoke rolled over the heads
      of the audience. As the Professor became visible through the thinning
      smoke, he looked around for his audience. Every man was under the benches,
      and groans came from all parts of the hall. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said the
      Professor, in anxious tones, &ldquo;that no one has been hurt. I am afraid
      that I took up too much of the substance on the point of the needle, but
      it will enable you to imagine the effect of a larger quantity. Pray seat
      yourselves again. This is my last experiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the audience again seated itself, another mutual sigh ascended to the
      roof. The Professor drew the chairman&rsquo;s chair towards him and sat
      down, wiping his grimy brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man instantly arose and said, &ldquo;I move a vote of thanks to
      Professor Slivers for the interesting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor raised his hand. &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      have not quite finished. I have a proposal to make to you. You see that
      cloud of smoke hovering over our heads? In twenty minutes that smoke will
      percolate down through the atmosphere. I have told you but half of the
      benefits of this terrific explosive. When that smoke mixes with the
      atmosphere of the room it becomes a deadly poison. We all can live here
      for the next nineteen minutes in perfect safety, then at the first breath
      we draw we expire instantly. It is a lovely death. There is no pain, no
      contortion of the countenance, but we will be found here in the morning
      stark and stiff in our seats. I propose, gentlemen, that we teach London
      the great lesson it so much needs. No cause is without its martyrs. Let us
      be the martyrs of the great religion of Anarchy. I have left in my room
      papers telling just how and why we died. At midnight these sheets will be
      distributed to all the newspapers of London, and to-morrow the world will
      ring with our heroic names. I will now put the motion. All in favor of
      this signify it by the usual upraising of the right hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor&rsquo;s own right hand was the only one that was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now all of a contrary opinion,&rdquo; said the Professor, and at
      once every hand in the audience went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noes have it,&rdquo; said the Professor, but he did not seem to
      feel badly about it. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I see
      that you have guessed my second proposal, as I imagined you would, and
      though there will be no newspapers in London to-morrow to chronicle the
      fact, yet the newspapers of the rest of the world will tell of the
      destruction of this wicked city. I see by your looks that you are with me
      in this, my second proposal, which is the most striking thing ever
      planned, and is that we explode the whole of these pills in the basin. To
      make sure of this, I have sent to an agent in Manchester the full account
      of how it was done, and the resolutions brought forward at this meeting,
      and which doubtless you will accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, all in favor of the instant destruction of London
      signify it in the usual manner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Professor,&rdquo; said the man who had spoken previously,
      &ldquo;before you put that resolution I would like to move an amendment.
      This is a very serious proposal, and should not be lightly undertaken. I
      move as an amendment, therefore, that we adjourn this meeting to our rooms
      at Soho, and do the exploding there. I have some little business that must
      be settled before this grand project is put in motion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor then said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the amendment takes precedence.
      It is moved that this meeting be adjourned, so that you may consider the
      project at your club-rooms in Soho.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second that amendment,&rdquo; said fifteen of the audience rising
      together to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the absence of the regular chairman,&rdquo; said the Professor,
      &ldquo;it is my duty to put the amendment. All in favor of the amendment
      signify it by raising the right hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every hand was raised. &ldquo;The amendment, gentlemen, is carried. I
      shall be only too pleased to meet you to-morrow night at your club, and I
      will bring with me a larger quantity of my explosive. John, kindly go
      round and tell the man to unlock the doors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Simkins and Slivers called round the next night at the regular
      meeting-place of the Anarchists, they found no signs of a gathering, and
      never since the lecture has the Soho Anarchist League been known to hold a
      meeting. The Club has mysteriously dissolved.

    <h2>
      THE FEAR OF IT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sea was done with him. He had struggled manfully for his life, but
      exhaustion came at last, and, realizing the futility of further fighting,
      he gave up the battle. The tallest wave, the king of that roaring
      tumultuous procession racing from the wreck to the shore, took him in its
      relentless grasp, held him towering for a moment against the sky, whirled
      his heels in the air, dashed him senseless on the sand, and, finally,
      rolled him over and over, a helpless bundle, high up upon the sandy beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human life seems of little account when we think of the trifles that make
      toward the extinction or the extension of it. If the wave that bore
      Stanford had been a little less tall, he would have been drawn back into
      the sea by one that followed. If, as a helpless bundle, he had been turned
      over one time more or one less, his mouth would have pressed into the
      sand, and he would have died. As it was, he lay on his back with arms
      outstretched on either side, and a handful of dissolving sand in one
      clinched fist. Succeeding waves sometimes touched him, but he lay there
      unmolested by the sea with his white face turned to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblivion has no calendar. A moment or an eternity are the same to it. When
      consciousness slowly returned, he neither knew nor cared how time had
      fled. He was not quite sure that he was alive, but weakness rather than
      fear kept him from opening his eyes to find out whether the world they
      would look upon was the world they had last gazed at. His interest,
      however, was speedily stimulated by the sound of the English tongue. He
      was still too much dazed to wonder at it, and to remember that he was cast
      away on some unknown island in the Southern Seas. But the purport of the
      words startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be thankful. He is undoubtedly dead.&rdquo; This was said in
      a tone of infinite satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a murmur of pleasure at the announcement from those who
      were with the speaker. Stanford slowly opened his eyes, wondering what
      these savages were who rejoiced in the death of an inoffensive stranger
      cast upon their shores. He saw a group standing around him, but his
      attention speedily became concentrated on one face. The owner of it, he
      judged, was not more than nineteen years of age, and the face&mdash;at
      least so it seemed to Stanford at the time&mdash;was the most beautiful he
      had ever beheld. There was an expression of sweet gladness upon it until
      her eyes met his, then the joy faded from the face, and a look of dismay
      took its place. The girl seemed to catch her breath in fear, and tears
      filled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he is going to live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her hands, and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford closed his eyes wearily. &ldquo;I am evidently insane,&rdquo; he
      said to himself. Then, losing faith in the reality of things, he lost
      consciousness as well, and when his senses came to him again he found
      himself lying on a bed in a clean but scantily furnished room. Through an
      open window came the roar of the sea, and the thunderous boom of the
      falling waves brought to his mind the experiences through which he had
      passed. The wreck and the struggle with the waves he knew to be real, but
      the episode on the beach he now believed to have been but a vision
      resulting from his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened noiselessly, and, before he knew of anyone&rsquo;s entrance,
      a placid-faced nurse stood by his bed and asked him how he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I am at least alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse sighed, and cast down her eyes. Her lips moved, but she said
      nothing. Stanford looked at her curiously. A fear crept over him that he
      was hopelessly crippled for life, and that death was considered preferable
      to a maimed existence. He felt wearied, though not in pain, but he knew
      that sometimes the more desperate the hurt, the less the victim feels it
      at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are&mdash;are any of my&mdash;my bones broken, do you know?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You are bruised, but not badly hurt. You will soon recover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Stanford, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo;
      he added, with sudden interest, &ldquo;who was that girl who stood near me
      as I lay on the beach?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were several.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there was but one. I mean the girl with the beautiful eyes and
      a halo of hair like a glorified golden crown on her head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We speak not of our women in words like those,&rdquo; said the
      nurse, severely; &ldquo;you mean Ruth, perhaps, whose hair is plentiful
      and yellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford smiled. &ldquo;Words matter little,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be temperate in speech,&rdquo; replied the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may be temperate without, being teetotal. Plentiful and yellow,
      indeed! I have had a bad dream concerning those who found me. I thought
      that they&mdash;but it does not matter. She at least is not a myth. Do you
      happen to know if any others were saved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thankful to be able to say that every one was drowned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford started up with horror in his eyes. The demure nurse, with
      sympathetic tones, bade him not excite himself. He sank back on his
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room,&rdquo; he cried, feebly, &ldquo;Leave me&mdash;leave
      me.&rdquo; He turned his face toward the wall, while the woman left as
      silently as she had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone Stanford slid from the bed, intending to make his way to
      the door and fasten it. He feared that these savages, who wished him dead,
      would take measures to kill him when they saw he was going to recover. As
      he leaned against the bed, he noticed that the door had no fastening.
      There was a rude latch, but neither lock nor bolt. The furniture of the
      room was of the most meagre description, clumsily made. He staggered to
      the open window, and looked out. The remnants of the disastrous gale blew
      in upon him and gave him new life, as it had formerly threatened him with
      death. He saw that he was in a village of small houses, each cottage
      standing in its own plot of ground. It was apparently a village of one
      street, and over the roofs of the houses opposite he saw in the distance
      the white waves of the sea. What astonished him most was a church with its
      tapering spire at the end of the street&mdash;a wooden church such as he
      had seen in remote American settlements. The street was deserted, and
      there were no signs of life in the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have fallen in upon some colony of lunatics,&rdquo; he said
      to himself. &ldquo;I wonder to what country these people belong&mdash;either
      to England or the United States, I imagine&mdash;yet in all my travels I
      never heard of such a community.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mirror in the room, and it was impossible for him to know how
      he looked. His clothes were dry and powdered with salt. He arranged them
      as well as he could, and slipped out of the house unnoticed. When he
      reached the outskirts of the village he saw that the inhabitants, both men
      and women, were working in the fields some distance away. Coming towards
      the village was a girl with a water-can in either hand. She was singing as
      blithely as a lark until she saw Stanford, whereupon she paused both in
      her walk and in her song. Stanford, never a backward man, advanced, and
      was about to greet her when she forestalled him by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved, indeed, to see that you have recovered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s speech was frozen on his lip, and a frown settled
      off his brow. Seeing that he was annoyed, though why she could not guess,
      Ruth hastened to amend matters by adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, what I say is true. I am indeed sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry that I live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most heartily am I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to credit such a statement from one so&mdash;from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say so. Miriam has already charged me with being glad that
      you were not drowned. It would pain me deeply if you also believed as she
      does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him with swimming eyes, and the young man knew not what
      to answer. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some horrible mistake. I cannot make it out. Perhaps our
      words, though apparently the same, have a different meaning. Sit down,
      Ruth, I want to ask you some questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth cast a timorous glance towards the workers, and murmured something
      about not having much time to spare, but she placed the water-cans on the
      ground and sank down on the grass. Stanford throwing himself on the sward
      at her feet, but, seeing that she shrank back, he drew himself further
      from her, resting where he might gaze upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s eyes were downcast, which was necessary, for she occupied
      herself in pulling blade after blade of grass, sometimes weaving them
      together. Stanford had said he wished to question her, but he apparently
      forgot his intention, for he seemed wholly satisfied with merely looking
      at her. After the silence had lasted for some time, she lifted her eyes
      for one brief moment, and then asked the first question herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what land do you come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that also is an island, is it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at the &ldquo;also,&rdquo; and remembered that he had some
      questions to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is an island&mdash;also. The sea dashes wrecks on all four
      sides of it, but there is no village on its shores so heathenish that if a
      man is cast upon the beach the inhabitants do not rejoice because he has
      escaped death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth looked at him with amazement in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there, then, no religion in England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religion? England is the most religious country on the face of the
      earth. There are more cathedrals, more churches, more places of worship in
      England than in any other State that I know of. We send missionaries to
      all heathenish lands. The Government, itself, supports the Church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine, then, I mistook your meaning. I thought from what you
      said that the people of England feared death, and did not welcome it or
      rejoice when one of their number died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not fear death, and they do not rejoice when it comes. Far
      from it. From the peer to the beggar, everyone fights death as long as he
      can; the oldest cling to life as eagerly as the youngest. Not a man but
      will spend his last gold piece to ward off the inevitable even for an
      hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold piece&mdash;what is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford plunged his hand into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are some coins left. Here is a
      gold piece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl took it, and looked at it with keen interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pretty?&rdquo; she said, holding the yellow coin on
      her pink palm, and glancing up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the general opinion. To accumulate coins like that, men
      will lie, and cheat, and steal&mdash;yes, and work. Although they will
      give their last sovereign to prolong their lives, yet will they risk life
      itself to accumulate gold. Every business in England is formed merely for
      the gathering together of bits of metal like that in your hand; huge
      companies of men are formed so that it may be piled up in greater
      quantities. The man who has most gold has most power, and is generally the
      most respected; the company which makes most money is the one people are
      most anxious to belong to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth listened to him with wonder and dismay in her eyes. As he talked she
      shuddered, and allowed the yellow coin to slip from her hand to the
      ground. &ldquo;No wonder such a people fears death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not fear death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we, when we believe in heaven?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would you not be sorry if someone died whom you loved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could we be so selfish? Would you be sorry if your brother, or
      someone you loved, became possessed of whatever you value in England&mdash;a
      large quantity of this gold, for instance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. But then you see&mdash;well, it isn&rsquo;t exactly
      the same thing. If one you care for dies you are separated from him, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only for a short time, and that gives but another reason for
      welcoming death. It seems impossible that Christian people should fear to
      enter Heaven. Now I begin to understand why our forefathers left England,
      and why our teachers will never tell us anything about the people there. I
      wonder why missionaries are not sent to England to teach them the truth,
      and try to civilize the people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would, indeed, be coals to Newcastle. But there comes one of
      the workers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my father,&rdquo; cried the girl, rising. &ldquo;I fear I
      have been loitering. I never did such a thing before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who approached was stern of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the workers are athirst.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, without reply, picked up her pails and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been receiving,&rdquo; said the young man, coloring
      slightly, &ldquo;some instruction regarding your belief. I had been
      puzzled by several remarks I had heard, and wished to make inquiries
      concerning them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more fitting,&rdquo; said the man, coldly, &ldquo;that you
      should receive instruction from me or from some of the elders than from
      one of the youngest in the community. When you are so far recovered as to
      be able to listen to an exposition of our views, I hope to put forth such
      arguments as will convince you that they are the true views. If it should
      so happen that my arguments are not convincing, then I must request that
      you will hold no communication with our younger members. They must not be
      contaminated by the heresies of the outside world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford looked at Ruth standing beside the village well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you underrate the argumentative powers
      of the younger members. There is a text bearing upon the subject which I
      need not recall to you. I am already convinced.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE METAMORPHOSES OF JOHNSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was staying for some weeks at a lovely town in the Tyrol which I shall
      take the liberty of naming Schwindleburg. I conceal its real title because
      it charges what is termed a visitors&rsquo; tax, and a heavy visitors&rsquo;
      tax, exacting the same from me through the medium of my hotel bill. The
      town also made me pay for the excellent band that performs morning and
      afternoon in the Kurpark. Many continental health resorts support
      themselves by placing a tax upon visitors, a practice resorted to by no
      English town, and so I regard the imposition as a swindle, and I refuse to
      advertise any place that practises it. It is true that if you stay in
      Schwindleburg less than a week they do not tax you, but I didn&rsquo;t
      know that, and the hotel man, being wise in his own generation, did not
      present his bill until a day after the week was out, so I found myself in
      for the visitors&rsquo; tax and the music money before I was aware of it.
      Thus does a foolish person accumulate wisdom by foreign travel. I stayed
      on at this picturesque place, listening to the band every day, trying to
      get value for my money. I intended to keep much to myself, having work to
      do, and make no acquaintances, but I fell under the fascination of
      Johnson, thus breaking my rule. What is the use of making a rule if you
      can&rsquo;t have the pleasure of breaking it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the thing that first attracted me to Johnson was his utter
      negligence in the matter of his personal appearance. When he stepped down
      from the hotel &lsquo;bus he looked like a semi-respectable tramp. He wore
      a blue woolen shirt, with no collar or necktie. He had a slouch hat,
      without the usual affectation of a Tyrolese feather in it. His full beard
      had evidently not been trimmed for weeks, and he had one trouser-leg
      turned up. He had no alpenstock, and that also was a merit. So I said to
      myself, &ldquo;Here is a man free from the conventionalities of society.
      If I become acquainted with anybody it will be with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Johnson was an American from a Western city named Chicago, which I
      had heard of, and we &ldquo;palled on.&rdquo; He was very fond of music,
      and the band in the Kurpark was a good one, so we went there together
      twice a day, and talked as we walked up and down the gravel paths. He had
      been everywhere, and knew his way about; his conversation was interesting.
      In about a week I had come to love Johnson, and I think he rather liked
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as we returned together to the Hotel Post, he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to-morrow,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;off to Innsbruck.
      So I shall bid you good-bye. I am very glad indeed to have met you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that.&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I
      won&rsquo;t say good-bye now, I&rsquo;ll see you to the station to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that. I shall be away before you are up. We&rsquo;ll
      say good- bye here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We did, and when I had breakfast next morning I found Johnson had left by
      the early train. I wandered around the park that forenoon mourning for
      Johnson. The place seemed lonely without him. In the afternoon I explored
      some of the by-paths of the park within hearing distance of the band, when
      suddenly, to my intense surprise, I met my departed friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Johnson,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I thought you left this
      morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at me with no recognition in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my name is Baumgarten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking more closely at him I at once saw I was mistaken. I had been
      thinking of Johnson at the time, which probably accounted for the error.
      Still, his likeness to Johnson was remarkable&mdash;to Johnson well
      groomed. He had neatly-trimmed side-whiskers and moustache, while Johnson
      had a full beard. His round hat was new, and he wore an irreproachable
      collar, and even cuffs. Besides this he sported a cane, and evidently
      possessed many weaknesses to which Johnson was superior. I apologized for
      my mistake, and was about to walk on when Baumgarten showed signs of
      wishing to become acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just arrived,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and know nothing of the
      place. Have you been here long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two weeks,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then, you are a resident as it were. Are there any good ascents
      to be made around here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been informed that there are. I am not a climber myself,
      except by funicular railway. I am always content to take other people&rsquo;s
      figures for the heights. The only use I have for a mountain is to look at
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Baumgarten launched into a very interesting account of mountain
      dangers he had passed through. I found him a most entertaining talker,
      almost as fascinating as Johnson himself. He told me he was from Hanover,
      but he had been educated in Great Britain, which accounted for his perfect
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hotel are you at?&rdquo; he asked, as the band ceased playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am staying at the Post,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at the Adler. You must come to dine with me some evening, and
      I will make it even by dining with you. We can thus compare <i>table d&rsquo;hôtes</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Baumgarten improved on acquaintance in spite of his foppishness in dress.
      I almost forgot Johnson until one day I was reminded of him one day by
      Baumgarten saying, &ldquo;I leave to-night for Innsbruck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Innsbruck? Why, that&rsquo;s where Johnson is. You ought to meet
      him. He&rsquo;s an awfully good fellow. A little careless about his
      clothes, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to meet him. I know no one in Innsbruck. Do you
      happen to know the name of his hotel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. I don&rsquo;t even know Johnson&rsquo;s first name. But I&rsquo;ll
      write you a note of introduction on my card, and if you should come across
      him, give him my regards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Baumgarten accepted the card with thanks, and we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, being warm, I sat on a bench in the shade listening to the
      music. Now that Baumgarten had gone, I was meditating on his strange
      resemblance to Johnson, and remembering things. Someone sat down beside
      me, but I paid no attention to him. Finally he said: &ldquo;This seems to
      be a very good band.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I started at the sound of his voice, and looked at him too much astonished
      to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore a moustache, but no whiskers, and a green Tyrolese felt hat with a
      feather in it. An alpenstock leaned against the bench beside him, its iron
      point in the gravel. He wore knickerbockers; in fact, his whole appearance
      was that of the conventional mountaineer-tourist. But the voice! And the
      expression of the eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said the band is very good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Quite so. It&rsquo;s expensive, and it ought to be good. I&rsquo;m
      helping to pay for it. By the way, you arrived this morning, I take it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed. And you depart in a few days for Innsbruck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I go to Salzburg when I leave here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your name isn&rsquo;t Johnson&mdash;or&mdash;or Baumgarten, by
      any chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come neither from Chicago nor Hanover?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been in America, nor do I know Hanover. Anything else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else. It&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s none of my business,
      of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is none of your business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no secret about that. I am a Russian. My name is
      Katzoff. At least, these are the first and last syllables of my name. I
      never use my full name when I travel; it is too complicated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. And how do you account for your perfect English? Educated
      in England, I presume? Baumgarten was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was not. You know we Russians are reputed to be good
      linguists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had forgotten that. We will now return to the point from
      which we started. The band is excellent, and it is about to play one of
      four favorite selections, Mr. Katzburg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katzoff is the name. As to the selection, I don&rsquo;t know much
      about music, although I am fond of popular pieces.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katzoff and I got along very nicely, although I did not seem to like him
      as well as either Johnson or Baumgarten. He left for Salzburg without
      bidding me good-bye. Missing him one day, I called at the Angleterre, and
      the porter told me he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I searched for him, wondering in what garb I should find him. I
      passed him twice as he sat on the bench, before I was sure enough to
      accost him. The sacrifice of his moustache had made a remarkable
      difference. His clean-shaven face caused him to look at least ten years
      younger. He wore a tall silk hat, and a long black morning coat. I found
      myself hardly able to withdraw my eyes from the white spats that partially
      covered his polished boots. He was reading an English paper, and did not
      observe my scrutiny. I approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Johnson,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this <i>is</i> a lay out. You&rsquo;re
      English this time, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up in evident surprise. Fumbling around the front of his
      waistcoat for a moment, he found a black silk string, which he pulled,
      bringing to his hand a little round disc of glass. This he stuck in one
      eye, grimacing slightly to keep it in place, and so regarded me apparently
      with some curiosity. My certainty that it was Johnson wavered for a
      moment, but I braved it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That monocle is a triumph, Johnson. In combination with the spats
      it absolutely staggers me. If you had tried that on as Baumgarten I don&rsquo;t
      know that I should have recognized you. Johnson, what&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be laboring under some delusion,&rdquo; he said at
      last. &ldquo;My name is not Johnson. I am Lord Somerset Campbell, if you
      care to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m the Duke of
      Argyll, so we must be relatives. Blood is thicker than water, Campbell.
      Confess. Whom have you murdered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; said his lordship, slowly, &ldquo;that the largest
      lunatic asylum in the Tyrol is near here, but I was not aware that the
      patients were allowed to stroll in the Kurpark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, Johnson, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Campbell, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t please, as it happens. This masquerade has gone on
      long enough. What&rsquo;s your crime? Or are you on the other side of the
      fence? Are you practising the detective business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I don&rsquo;t know you, and I resent your
      impertinent curiosity. Allow me to wish you good-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Johnson, it has gone too far. You have played on
      my feelings, and I won&rsquo;t stand it. I&rsquo;ll go to the authorities
      and relate the circumstances. They are just suspicious enough to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which? The authorities or the circumstances?&rdquo; asked Johnson,
      sitting down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, my dear boy, both, and you know it. Now, Johnson, make a
      clean breast of it, I won&rsquo;t give you away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson sighed, and his glass dropped from his eye. He looked around
      cautiously. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>are</i> Johnson!&rdquo; I cried, with some exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t very sure,&rdquo; began Johnson.
      &ldquo;However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, but you should be above
      threatening a man. That was playing it low down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re from Chicago. Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on account of this accursed visitors&rsquo; tax.
      That I decline to pay. I stay just under the week at a hotel, and then
      take a &lsquo;bus to the station, and another &lsquo;bus to another hotel.
      Of course my mistake was getting acquainted with you. I never suspected
      you were going to stay here a month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you let me know? Your misdemeanor is one I
      thoroughly sympathize with. I wouldn&rsquo;t have said anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took a fellow into my confidence once before. He told it as a
      dead secret to a friend, and the friend thought it a good joke, and
      related it, always under oath that it should go no further. The
      authorities had me arrested before the week was out, and fined me heavily
      besides exacting the tax.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;bus fares, the changing, and all that
      amount to as much as the tax?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it does. It isn&rsquo;t the money I object to, it&rsquo;s
      the principle of the thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This interview was the last I ever had with Johnson. About a week later I
      read in the Visitors&rsquo; List that Lord Somerset Campbell, who had been
      a guest of the Victoria (the swell hotel of the place), had left
      Schwindleburg for Innsbruck.

    <h2>
      THE RECLAMATION OF JOE HOLLENDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The public-houses of Burwell Road&mdash;and there were many of them for
      the length of the street&mdash;were rather proud of Joe Hollends. He was a
      perfected specimen of the work a pub produces. He was probably the most
      persistent drunkard the Road possessed, and the periodical gathering in of
      Joe by the police was one of the stock sights of the street. Many of the
      inhabitants could be taken to the station by one policeman; some required
      two; but Joe&rsquo;s average was four. He had been heard to boast that on
      one occasion he had been accompanied to the station by seven bobbies, but
      that was before the force had studied Joe and got him down to his correct
      mathematical equivalent. Now they tripped him up, a policeman taking one
      kicking leg and another the other, while the remaining two attended to the
      upper part of his body. Thus they carried him, followed by an admiring
      crowd, and watched by other envious drunkards who had to content
      themselves with a single officer when they went on a similar spree.
      Sometimes Joe managed to place a kick where it would do the most good
      against the stomach of a policeman, and when the officer rolled over there
      was for a few moments a renewal of the fight, silent on the part of the
      men and vociferous on the part of the drunkard, who had a fine flow of
      abusive language. Then the procession went on again. It was perfectly
      useless to put Joe on the police ambulance, for it required two men to sit
      on him while in transit, and the barrow is not made to stand such a load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when Joe staggered out of the pub and fell in the gutter, the
      ambulance did its duty, and trundled Joe to his abiding place, but the
      real fun occurred when Joe was gathered in during the third stage of his
      debauch. He passed through the oratorical stage, then the maudlin or
      sentimental stage, from which he emerged into the fighting stage, when he
      was usually ejected into the street, where he forthwith began to make Rome
      howl, and paint the town red. At this point the policeman&rsquo;s whistle
      sounded, and the force knew Joe was on the warpath, and that duty called
      them to the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was believed in the neighborhood that Joe had been a college man, and
      this gave him additional standing with his admirers. His eloquence was
      undoubted, after several glasses varying in number according to the
      strength of their contents, and a man who had heard the great political
      speakers of the day admitted that none of them could hold a candle to Joe
      when he got on the subject of the wrongs of the working man and the
      tyranny of the capitalist. It was generally understood that Joe might have
      been anything he liked, and that he was no man&rsquo;s enemy but his own.
      It was also hinted that he could tell the bigwigs a thing or two if he had
      been consulted in affairs of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when Joe was slowly progressing as usual, with his feet in
      the air, towards the station, supported by the requisite number of
      policemen, and declaiming to the delight of the accompanying crowd, a
      woman stood with her back to the brick wall, horror-stricken at the sight.
      She had a pale, refined face, and was dressed in black. Her self-imposed
      mission was among these people, but she had never seen Joe taken to the
      station before, and the sight, which was so amusing to the neighborhood,
      was shocking to her. She enquired about Joe, and heard the usual story
      that he was no man&rsquo;s enemy but his own, although they might in
      justice have added the police. Still, a policeman was hardly looked upon
      as a human being in that neighborhood. Miss Johnson reported the case to
      the committee of the Social League, and took counsel. Then it was that the
      reclamation of Joe Hollends was determined on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe received Miss Johnson with subdued dignity, and a demeanor that
      delicately indicated a knowledge on his part of her superiority and his
      own degradation. He knew how a lady should be treated even if he was a
      drunkard, as he told his cronies afterwards. Joe was perfectly willing to
      be reclaimed. Heretofore in his life, no one had ever extended the hand of
      fellowship to him. Human sympathy was what Joe needed, and precious little
      he had had of it. There were more kicks than halfpence in this world for a
      poor man. The rich did not care what became of the poor; not they&mdash;a
      proposition which Miss Johnson earnestly denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the tenets of the committee that where possible the poor
      should help the poor. It was resolved to get Joe a decent suit of clothes
      and endeavor to find him a place where work would enable him to help
      himself. Miss Johnson went around the neighborhood and collected pence for
      the reclamation. Most people were willing to help Joe, although it was
      generally felt that the Road would be less gay when he took on sober
      habits. In one room, however, Miss Johnson was refused the penny she
      pleaded for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot spare even a penny,&rdquo; said the woman, whose sickly
      little boy clung to her skirts. &ldquo;My husband is just out of work
      again. He has had only four weeks&rsquo; work this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Johnson looked around the room and saw why there was no money. It was
      quite evident where the earnings of the husband had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was much better furnished than the average apartment of the
      neighborhood. There were two sets of dishes where one would have been
      quite sufficient. On the mantelshelf and around the walls were various
      unnecessary articles which cost money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Johnson noted all this but said nothing, although she resolved to
      report it to the committee. In union is strength and in multitude of
      counsel there is wisdom. Miss Johnson had great faith in the wisdom of the
      committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has your husband been out of work?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a few days, but times are very bad and he is afraid he will
      not get another situation soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his trade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a carpenter and a good workman&mdash;sober and steady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you give me his name I will put it down in our books. Perhaps we
      may be able to help him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Morris is his name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Johnson wrote it down on her tablets, and when she left, the wife
      felt vaguely grateful for benefits to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts of the case were reported to the committee, and Miss Johnson was
      deputed to expostulate with Mrs. Morris upon her extravagance. John Morris&rsquo;s
      name was put upon the books among the names of many other unemployed
      persons. The case of Joe Hollends then came up, and elicited much
      enthusiasm. A decent suit of clothing had been purchased with part of the
      money collected for him, and it was determined to keep the rest in trust,
      to be doled out to him as occasion warranted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two persuasive ladies undertook to find a place for him in one of the
      factories, if such a thing were possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe felt rather uncomfortable in his new suit of clothes, and seemed to
      regard the expenditure as, all in all, a waste of good money. He was also
      disappointed to find that the funds collected were not to be handed over
      to him in a lump. It was not the money he cared about, he said, but the
      evident lack of trust. If people had trusted him more, he might have been
      a better man. Trust and human sympathy were what Joe Hollends needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two persuasive ladies appealed to Mr. Stillwell, the proprietor of a
      small factory for the making of boxes. They said that if Hollends got a
      chance they were sure he would reform. Stillwell replied that he had no
      place for anyone. He had enough to do to keep the men already in his
      employ. Times were dull in the box business, and he was turning away
      applicants every day who were good workmen and who didn&rsquo;t need to be
      reformed. However, the ladies were very persuasive, and it is not given to
      every man to be able to refuse the appeal of a pretty woman, not to
      mention two of them. Stillwell promised to give Hollends a chance, said he
      would consult with his foreman, and let the ladies know what could be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Hollends did not receive the news of his luck with the enthusiasm that
      might have been expected. Many a man was tramping London in search of
      employment and finding none, therefore even the ladies who were so
      solicitous about Joe&rsquo;s welfare thought he should be thankful that
      work came unsought. He said he would do his best, which is, when you come
      to think of it, all that we have a right to expect from any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days afterwards Jack Morris applied to Mr. Stillwell for a job, but
      he had no sub-committee of persuasive ladies to plead for him. He would be
      willing to work half-time or quarter-time for that matter. He had a wife
      and boy dependent on him. He could show that he was a good workman and he
      did not drink. Thus did Morris recite his qualifications to the unwilling
      ears of Stillwell the box maker. As he left the place disheartened with
      another refusal, he was overtaken by Joe Hollends. Joe was a lover of his
      fellow-man, and disliked seeing anyone downhearted. He had one infallible
      cure for dejection. Having just been discharged, he was in high spirits,
      because his prediction of his own failure as a reformed character, if work
      were a condition of the reclamation, had just been fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, old man,&rdquo; he cried, slapping Morris on the
      shoulder, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Come and have a drink with me. I&rsquo;ve
      got the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morris, who knew the professional drunkard but
      slightly, and did not care for further acquaintance with him, &ldquo;I
      want work, not beer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man to his taste. Why don&rsquo;t you ask at the box factory?
      You can have my job and welcome. The foreman&rsquo;s just discharged me.
      Said I wouldn&rsquo;t work myself, and kept the men off theirs. Thought I
      talked too much about capital and labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could get your job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. No harm in trying. If they don&rsquo;t take you on,
      come into the Red Lion&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be there&mdash;and have a drop. It&rsquo;ll
      cheer you up a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris appealed in vain to the foreman. They had more men now in the
      factory than they needed, he said. So Morris went to the Red Lion, where
      he found Hollends ready to welcome him. They had several glasses together,
      and Hollends told him of the efforts of the Social League in the
      reclamation line, and his doubts of their ultimate success. Hollends
      seemed to think the ladies of the League were deeply indebted to him for
      furnishing them with such a good subject for reformation. That night Joe&rsquo;s
      career reached a triumphant climax, for the four policeman had to appeal
      to the bystanders for help in the name of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Morris went home unaided. He had not taken many glasses, but he knew
      he should have avoided drink altogether, for he had some experience of its
      power in his younger days. He was, therefore, in a quarrelsome mood, ready
      to blame everyone but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his wife in tears, and saw Miss Johnson sitting there, evidently
      very miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; asked Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife dried her eyes, and said it was nothing. Miss Johnson had been
      giving her some advice, which she was thankful for. Morris glared at the
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to do with us?&rdquo; he demanded rudely. His
      wife caught him by the arm, but he angrily tossed aside her hand. Miss
      Johnson arose, fearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no business here. We want none of your advice. You get
      out of this.&rdquo; Then, impatiently to his wife, who strove to calm him,
      &ldquo;Shut up, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Johnson was afraid he would strike her as she passed him going to the
      door, but he merely stood there, following her exit with lowering brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified lady told her experience to the sympathizing members of the
      committee. She had spoken to Mrs. Morris of her extravagance in buying so
      many things that were not necessary when her husband had work. She advised
      the saving of the money. Mrs. Morris had defended her apparent lavish
      expenditure by saying that there was no possibility of saving money. She
      bought useful things, and when her husband was out of work she could
      always get a large percentage of their cost from the pawnbroker. The
      pawnshop, she had tearfully explained to Miss Johnson, was the only bank
      of the poor. The idea of the pawnshop as a bank, and not as a place of
      disgrace, was new to Miss Johnson, but before anything further could be
      said the husband had come in. One of the committee, who knew more about
      the district than Miss Johnson, affirmed that there was something to say
      for the pawnbroker as the banker of the poor. The committee were unanimous
      in condemning the conduct of Morris, and it says much for the members
      that, in spite of the provocation one of them had received, they did not
      take the name of so undeserving a man from their list of the unemployed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sad relapse of Joe Hollends next occupied the attention of the League.
      His fine had been paid, and he had expressed himself as deeply grieved at
      his own frailty. If the foreman had been less harsh with him and had given
      him a chance, things might have been different. It was resolved to send
      Joe to the seaside so that he might have an opportunity of toning up his
      system to resist temptation. Joe enjoyed his trip to the sea. He always
      liked to encounter a new body of police unaccustomed to his methods. He
      toned up his system so successfully the first day on the sands that he
      spent the night in the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, the portable property in the rooms of the Morrises
      disappeared into the pawnshop. Misfortune, as usual, did not come singly.
      The small boy was ill, and Morris himself seemed to be unable to resist
      the temptation of the Red Lion. The unhappy woman took her boy to the
      parish doctor, who was very busy, but he gave what attention he could to
      the case. He said all the boy needed was nourishing food and country air.
      Mrs. Morris sighed, and decided to take the little boy oftener to the
      park, but the way was long, and he grew weaker day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, she succeeded in interesting her husband in the little fellow&rsquo;s
      condition. He consented to take the boy to the doctor with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind what I say,&rdquo; she
      complained. &ldquo;Perhaps he will pay attention to a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris was not naturally a morose person, but continued disappointment was
      rapidly making him so. He said nothing, but took the boy in his arms, and,
      followed by his wife, went to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This boy was here before,&rdquo; said the physician, which tended
      to show that he had paid more attention to the case than Mrs. Morris
      thought. &ldquo;He is very much worse. You will have to take him to the
      country or he will die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I send him to the country?&rdquo; asked Morris, sullenly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out of work for months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you friends in the country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t your wife any friends in the country who would take
      her and the lad for a month or so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to pawn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would advise you to pawn everything you own, or sell it if
      you can, and take the boy on your back and tramp to the country. You will
      get work there probably more easily than in the city. Here are ten
      shillings to help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; said Morris, in a surly tone.
      &ldquo;I want work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no work to give you, so I offer you what I have. I haven&rsquo;t
      as much of that as I could wish. You are a fool not to take what the gods
      send.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris, without replying, gathered up his son in his arms and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a bottle of tonic for him.&rdquo; said the doctor to Mrs.
      Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the half-sovereign on the bottle as he passed it to her. She
      silently thanked him with her wet eyes, hoping that a time would come when
      she could repay the money. The doctor had experience enough to know that
      they were not to be classed among his usual visitors. He was not in the
      habit of indiscriminately bestowing gold coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreary journey, and they were a long time shaking off the
      octopus-like tentacles of the great city, that reached further and further
      into he country each year, as if it lived on consuming the green fields.
      Morris walked ahead with the boy on his back, and his wife followed.
      Neither spoke, and the sick lad did not complain. As they were nearing a
      village, the boy&rsquo;s head sunk on his father&rsquo;s shoulder. The
      mother quickened her pace, and came up to them stroking the head of her
      sleeping son. Suddenly, she uttered a smothered cry and took the boy in
      her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Morris, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but sat by the roadside with the boy on her lap,
      swaying her body to and fro over him, moaning as she did so. Morris needed
      no answer. He stood on the road with hardening face, and looked down on
      his wife and child without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindly villagers arranged the little funeral, and when it was over
      Jack Morris and his wife stood again on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, dear,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go back to that
      horrible place. We belong to the country, and the city is so hard and
      cruel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back. You can do as you like.&rdquo; Then,
      relenting a little, he added, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t brought much luck to
      you, my girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew her husband was a stubborn man, and set in his way, so,
      unprotesting, she followed him in, as she had followed out, stumbling many
      times, for often her eyes did not see the road. And so they returned to
      their empty rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Morris went to look for work at the Red Lion. There he met that
      genial comrade, Joe Hollends, who had been reformed, and who had backslid
      twice since Jack had foregathered with him before. It is but fair to Joe
      to admit that he had never been optimistic about his own reclamation, but
      being an obliging man, even when he was sober, he was willing to give the
      Social League every chance. Jack was deeply grieved at the death of his
      son, although he had said no word to his wife that would show it. It
      therefore took more liquor than usual to bring him up to the point of good
      comradeship that reigned at the Red Lion. When he and Joe left the tavern
      that night it would have taken an expert to tell which was the more
      inebriated. They were both in good fighting trim, and were both in the
      humor for a row. The police, who had reckoned on Joe alone, suddenly found
      a new element in the fight that not only upset their calculations but
      themselves as well. It was a glorious victory, and, as both fled down a
      side street, Morris urged Hollends to come along, for the representatives
      of law and order have the habit of getting reinforcements which often turn
      a victory into a most ignominious defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; panted Hollends. &ldquo;The beggars have hurt
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along. I know a place where we are safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Drunk as he was, Jack succeeded in finding the hole in the wall that
      allowed him to enter a vacant spot behind the box factory. There Hollends
      lay down with a groan, and there Morris sank beside him in a drunken
      sleep. The police were at last revenged, and finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the grey daylight brought Morris to a dazed sense of where he was, he
      found his companion dead beside him. He had a vague fear that he would be
      tried for murder, but it was not so. From the moment that Hollends, in his
      fall, struck his head on the curb, the Providence which looks after the
      drunken deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inquest accomplished one good object. It attracted the attention
      of the Social League to Jack Morris, and they are now endeavoring to
      reclaim him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether they succeed or not, he was a man that was certainly once worth
      saving.

    <h2>
      THE TYPE-WRITTEN LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a man has battled with poverty all his life, fearing it as he fought
      it, feeling for its skinny throat to throttle it, and yet dreading all the
      while the coming of the time when it would gain the mastery and throttle
      him&mdash;when such a man is told that he is rich, it might be imagined he
      would receive the announcement with hilarity. When Richard Denham realized
      that he was wealthy he became even more sobered than usual, and drew a
      long breath as if he had been running a race and had won it. The man who
      brought him the news had no idea he had told Denham anything novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He merely happened to say, &ldquo;You are a rich man, Mr. Denham, and will
      never miss it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Denham had never before been called a rich man, and up to that moment he
      had not thought of himself as wealthy. He wrote out the check asked of
      him, and his visitor departed gratefully, leaving the merchant with
      something to ponder over. He was as surprised with the suddenness of the
      thing as if someone had left him a legacy. Yet the money was all of his
      own accumulating, but his struggle had been so severe, and he had been so
      hopeless about it, that from mere habit he exerted all his energies long
      after the enemy was overcome&mdash;just as the troops at New Orleans
      fought a fierce battle not knowing that the war was over. He had sprung
      from such a hopelessly poor family. Poverty had been their inheritance
      from generation to generation. It was the invariable legacy that father
      had left to son in the Denham family. All had accepted their lot with
      uncomplaining resignation, until Richard resolved he would at least have a
      fight for it. And now the fight had been won. Denham sat in his office
      staring at the dingy wall-paper so long, that Rogers, the chief clerk, put
      his head in and said in a deferential voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything more to-night, Mr. Denham?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Denham started as if that question in that tone had not been asked him
      every night for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogers was astonished, but too well trained to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything more to-night, Mr. Denham?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, quite so. No, Rogers, thank you, nothing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Denham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, yes. Good-night, Rogers, good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Denham left his office and went out into the street everything
      had an unusual appearance to him. He walked along, unheeding the
      direction. He looked at the fine residences and realized that he might
      have a fine residence if he wanted it. He saw handsome carriages; he too
      might set up an equipage. The satisfaction these thoughts produced was
      brief. Of what use would a fine house or an elegant carriage be to him? He
      knew no one to invite to the house or to ride with him in the carriage. He
      began to realize how utterly alone in the world he was. He had no friends,
      no acquaintances even. The running dog, with its nose to the ground, sees
      nothing of the surrounding scenery. He knew men in a business way, of
      course, and doubtless each of them had a home in the suburbs somewhere,
      but he could not take a business man by the shoulders and say to him,
      &ldquo;Invite me to your house; I am lonely; I want to know people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If he got such an invitation, he would not know what to do with himself.
      He was familiar with the counting-room and its language, but the
      drawing-room was an unexplored country to him, where an unknown tongue was
      spoken. On the road to wealth he had missed something, and it was now too
      late to go back for it. Only the day before, he had heard one of the
      clerks, who did not know he was within earshot, allude to him as &ldquo;the
      old man.&rdquo; He felt as young as ever he did, but the phrase, so
      lightly spoken, made him catch his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was now walking through the park, and away from the busy streets, he
      took off his hat and ran his fingers through his grizzled hair, looking at
      his hand when he had done so, as if the grey, like wet paint, might have
      come off. He thought of a girl he knew once, who perhaps would have
      married him if he had asked her, as he was tempted to do. But that had
      always been the mistake of the Denhams. They had all married young except
      himself, and so sunk deeper into the mire of poverty, pressed down by a
      rapidly-increasing progeny. The girl had married a baker, he remembered.
      Yes, that was a long time ago. The clerk was not far wrong when he called
      him an old man. Suddenly, another girl arose before his mental vision&mdash;a
      modern girl&mdash;very different indeed to the one who married the baker.
      She was the only woman in the world with whom he was on speaking terms,
      and he knew her merely because her light and nimble fingers played the
      business sonata of one note on his office typewriter. Miss Gale was
      pretty, of course&mdash; all typewriter girls are&mdash;and it was
      generally understood in the office that she belonged to a good family who
      had come down in the world. Her somewhat independent air deepened this
      conviction and kept the clerks at a distance. She was a sensible girl who
      realized that the typewriter paid better than the piano, and accordingly
      turned the expertness of her white fingers to the former instrument.
      Richard Denham sat down upon a park bench. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked
      himself. There was no reason against it except that he felt he had not the
      courage. Nevertheless, he formed a desperate resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, business went on as usual. Letters were answered, and the time
      arrived when Miss Gale came in to see if he had any further commands that
      day. Denham hesitated. He felt vaguely that a business office was not the
      proper place for a proposal; yet he knew he would be at a disadvantage
      anywhere else. In the first place, he had no plausible excuse for calling
      upon the young woman at home, and, in the second place, he knew if he once
      got there he would be stricken dumb. It must either be at his office or
      nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a moment, Miss Gale,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;I
      wanted to consult you about a matter&mdash;about a business matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gale seated herself, and automatically placed on her knee the
      shorthand writing-pad ready to take down his instructions. She looked up
      at him expectantly. Denham, in an embarrassed manner, ran his fingers
      through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;of taking a partner. The
      business is very prosperous now. In fact, it has been so for some time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Miss Gale interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think I should have a partner. It is about that I wanted to
      speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be better to consult with Mr.
      Rogers? He knows more about business than I. But perhaps it is Mr. Rogers
      who is to be the partner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not Rogers. Rogers is a good man. But&mdash;it is not
      Rogers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think in an important matter like this Mr. Rogers, or
      someone who knows the business as thoroughly as he does, would be able to
      give you advice that would be of some value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want advice exactly. I have made up my mind to have a
      partner, if the partner is willing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Denham mopped his brow. It was going to be even more difficult than he had
      anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it, then, a question of the capital the partner is to bring in?&rdquo;
      asked Miss Gale, anxious to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I don&rsquo;t wish any capital. I have enough for both. And
      the business is very prosperous, Miss Gale&mdash;and&mdash;and has been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman raised her eyebrows in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t intend to share the profits with a partner
      who brings no capital into the business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I do. You see, as I said, I have no need for more
      capital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if that is the case, I think you should consult Mr. Rogers
      before you commit yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rogers wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand either. It seems to me a
      foolish thing to do&mdash;that is, if you want my advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I want it. But it isn&rsquo;t as foolish as you think. I
      should have had a partner long ago. That is where I made the mistake. I&rsquo;ve
      made up my mind on that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see that I can be of any use&mdash;if your mind
      is already made up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you can. I&rsquo;m a little afraid that my offer may not
      be accepted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sure to be, if the man has any sense. No fear of such an
      offer being refused! Offers like that are not to be had every day. It will
      be accepted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so, Miss Gale? I am glad that is your opinion.
      Now, what I wanted to consult you about, is the form of the offer. I would
      like to put it&mdash;well&mdash;delicately, you know, so that it would not
      be refused, nor give offence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. You want me to write a letter to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, exactly,&rdquo; cried Denham with some relief. He had not
      thought of sending a letter before. Now, he wondered why he had not
      thought of it. It was so evidently the best way out of a situation that
      was extremely disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you spoken to him about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him? What him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your future partner, about the proposal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Oh, no. That is&mdash;I have spoken to nobody but you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are determined not to speak to Mr. Rogers before you write?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. It&rsquo;s none of Roger&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Miss Gale shortly, bending over her
      writing-pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that her opinion of Denham&rsquo;s wisdom was steadily
      lowering. Suddenly, she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much shall I say the annual profits are? Or do you want that
      mentioned?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I would mention that. You see, I don&rsquo;t
      wish this arrangement to be carried out on a monetary basis&mdash;not
      altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what basis then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I can hardly say. On a personal basis, perhaps. I rather
      hope that the person&mdash;that my partner&mdash;would, you know, like to
      be associated with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a friendly basis, do you mean?&rdquo; asked Miss Gale,
      mercilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Friendly, of course&mdash;and perhaps more than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gale looked up at him with a certain hopelessness of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not write a note inviting your future partner to call upon you
      here, or anywhere else that would be convenient, and then discuss the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Denham looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do. No; it wouldn&rsquo;t
      do. I would much rather settle everything by correspondence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not be able to compose a letter that will suit
      you. There seem to be so many difficulties. It is very unusual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, and that is why I knew no one but you could help me,
      Miss Gale. If it pleases you, it will please me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gale shook her head, but, after a few moments, she said, &ldquo;How
      will this do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; cried Mr. Denham; &ldquo;that seems rather a
      formal opening, doesn&rsquo;t it? How would it read if you put it &lsquo;Dear
      friend&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it so.&rdquo; She crossed out the &ldquo;sir&rdquo; and
      substituted the word suggested. Then, she read the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Friend,&mdash;I have for some time past been desirous of
      taking a partner, and would be glad if you would consider the question and
      consent to join me in this business. The business is, and has been for
      several years, very prosperous, and, as I shall require no capital from
      you, I think you will find my offer a very advantageous one. I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I would put it quite that way.&rdquo;
      said Denham, with some hesitation. &ldquo;It reads as if I were offering
      everything, and that my partner&mdash;well, you see what I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; said Miss Gale, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better put it on the friendly basis, as you suggested a moment ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suggest anything, Mr. Denham. Perhaps it would be
      better if you would dictate the letter exactly as you want it. I knew I
      could not write one that would please you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does please me, but I&rsquo;m thinking of my future partner. You
      are doing first-rate&mdash;better than I could do. But just put it on the
      friendly basis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... join me in this business. I make you this offer entirely from a
      friendly, and not from a financial, standpoint, hoping that you like me
      well enough to be associated with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else, Mr. Denham?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I think that covers the whole ground. It will look rather
      short, type-written, won&rsquo;t it? Perhaps you might add something to
      show that I shall be exceedingly disappointed if my offer is not accepted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said Miss Gale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add that though.
      &lsquo;Yours truly,&rsquo; or 'Yours very truly&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might end it &lsquo;Your friend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid click of the typewriter was heard for a few moments in the next
      room, and then Miss Gale came out with the completed letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have the boy copy it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you, no!&rdquo; answered Mr. Denham, with evident
      trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman said to herself, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want Mr. Rogers
      to know, and no wonder. It is a most unbusiness-like proposal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said aloud, &ldquo;Shall you want me again to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Gale; and thank you very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, Miss Gale came into Mr. Denham&rsquo;s office with a smile
      on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a funny mistake last night, Mr. Denham,&rdquo; she said,
      as she took off her wraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; he asked, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You sent that letter to my address. I got it this morning. I
      opened it, for I thought it was for me, and that perhaps you did not need
      me to-day. But I saw at once that you put it in the wrong envelope. Did
      you want me to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on his tongue to say, &ldquo;I want you every day,&rdquo; but he
      merely held out his hand for the letter, and looked at it as if he could
      not account for its having gone astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Miss Gale came late, and she looked frightened. It was
      evident that Denham was losing his mind. She put the letter down before
      him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You addressed that to me the second time, Mr. Denham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a look of haggard anxiety about Denham that gave color to her
      suspicions. He felt that it was now or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you answer it, Miss Gale?&rdquo; he said
      gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She backed away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer it?&rdquo; she repeated faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. If I got a letter twice, I would answer it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she cried, with her hand on the door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what the letter says. I want you for my partner. I want to
      marry you, and d&mdash;n financial considerations&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Gale, in a long-drawn, quivering sigh. She
      was doubtless shocked at the word he had used, and fled to her typewriting
      room, closing the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Denham paced up and down the floor for a few moments, then rapped
      lightly at her door, but there was no response. He put on his hat and went
      out into the street. After a long and aimless walk, he found himself again
      at his place of business. When he went in, Rogers said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gale has left, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and she has given notice. Says she is not coming back, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his own room and found a letter marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo;
      on his desk. He tore it open, and read in neatly type-written characters:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have resigned my place as typewriter girl, having been offered a
      better situation. I am offered a partnership in the house of Richard
      Denham. I have decided to accept the position, not so much on account of
      its financial attractions, as because I shall be glad, on a friendly
      basis, to be associated with the gentleman I have named. Why did you put
      me to all that worry writing that idiotic letter, when a few words would
      have saved ever so much bother? You evidently <i>need</i> a partner. My
      mother will be pleased to meet you any time you call. You have the
      address,&mdash;Your friend,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   &ldquo;MARGARET GALE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogers!&rdquo; shouted Denham, joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered that estimable man, putting his head into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advertise for another typewriter girl, Rogers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Rogers.

      THE DOOM OF LONDON.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.&mdash;THE SELF-CONCEIT OF THE 20TH CENTURY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I trust I am thankful my life has been spared until I have seen that most
      brilliant epoch of the world&rsquo;s history&mdash;the middle of the 20th
      century. It would be useless for any man to disparage the vast
      achievements of the past fifty years, and if I venture to call attention
      to the fact, now apparently forgotten, that the people of the 19th century
      succeeded in accomplishing many notable things, it must not be imagined
      that I intend thereby to discount in any measure the marvellous inventions
      of the present age. Men have always been somewhat prone to look with a
      certain condescension upon those who lived fifty or a hundred years before
      them. This seems to me the especial weakness of the present age; a feeling
      of national self-conceit, which, when it exists, should at least be kept
      as much in the background as possible. It will astonish many to know that
      such also was a failing of the people of the 19th century. They imagined
      themselves living in an age of progress, and while I am not foolish enough
      to attempt to prove that they did anything really worth recording, yet it
      must be admitted by any unprejudiced man of research that their inventions
      were at least stepping-stones to those of to-day. Although the telephone
      and telegraph, and all other electrical appliances, are now to be found
      only in our national museums, or in the private collections of those few
      men who take any interest in the doings of the last century, nevertheless,
      the study of the now obsolete science of electricity led up to the recent
      discovery of vibratory ether which does the work of the world so
      satisfactorily. The people of the 19th century were not fools, and
      although I am well aware that this statement will be received with scorn
      where it attracts any attention whatever, yet who can say that the
      progress of the next half-century may not be as great as that of the one
      now ended, and that the people of the next century may not look upon us
      with the same contempt which we feel toward those who lived fifty years
      ago?

      Being an old man, I am, perhaps, a laggard who dwells in the past rather
      than the present; still, it seems to me that such an article as that which
      appeared recently in <i>Blackwood</i> from the talented pen of Prof.
      Mowberry, of Oxford University, is utterly unjustifiable. Under the title
      of &ldquo;Did the People of London Deserve their Fate?&rdquo; he endeavors
      to show that the simultaneous blotting out of millions of human beings was
      a beneficial event, the good results of which we still enjoy. According to
      him, Londoners were so dull-witted and stupid, so incapable of
      improvement, so sodden in the vice of mere money- gathering, that nothing
      but their total extinction would have sufficed, and that, instead of being
      an appalling catastrophe, the doom of London was an unmixed blessing. In
      spite of the unanimous approval with which this article has been received
      by the press, I still maintain that such writing is uncalled for, and that
      there is something to be said for the London of the 19th century.

    <h2>
      WHY LONDON, WARNED, WAS UNPREPARED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The indignation I felt in first reading the article alluded to still
      remains with me, and it has caused me to write these words, giving some
      account of what I must still regard, in spite of the sneers of the present
      age, as the most terrible disaster that ever overtook a portion of the
      human race. I shall not endeavor to place before those who read, any
      record of the achievements pertaining to the time in question. But I would
      like to say a few words about the alleged stupidity of the people of
      London in making no preparations for a disaster regarding which they had
      continual and ever-recurring warning. They have been compared with the
      inhabitants of Pompeii making merry at the foot of a volcano. In the first
      place, fogs were so common in London, especially in winter, that no
      particular attention was paid to them. They were merely looked upon as
      inconvenient annoyances, interrupting traffic and prejudicial to health,
      but I doubt if anyone thought it possible for a fog to become one vast
      smothering mattress pressed down upon a whole metropolis, extinguishing
      life as if the city suffered from hopeless hydrophobia. I have read that
      victims bitten by mad dogs were formerly put out of their sufferings in
      that way, although I doubt much if such things were ever actually done,
      notwithstanding the charges of savage barbarity now made against the
      people of the 19th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably, the inhabitants of Pompeii were so accustomed to the eruptions
      of Vesuvius that they gave no thought to the possibility of their city
      being destroyed by a storm of ashes and an overflow of lava. Rain
      frequently descended upon London, and if a rainfall continued long enough
      it would certainly have flooded the metropolis, but no precautions were
      taken against a flood from the clouds. Why, then, should the people have
      been expected to prepare for a catastrophe from fog, such as there had
      never been any experience of in the world&rsquo;s history? The people of
      London were far from being the sluggish dolts present-day writers would
      have us believe.

    <h2>
      THE COINCIDENCE THAT CAME AT LAST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As fog has now been abolished both on sea and land, and as few of the
      present generation have even seen one, it may not be out of place to give
      a few lines on the subject of fogs in general, and the London fogs in
      particular, which through local peculiarities differed from all others. A
      fog was simply watery vapor rising from the marshy surface of the land or
      from the sea, or condensed into a cloud from the saturated atmosphere. In
      my day, fogs were a great danger at sea, for people then travelled by
      means of steamships that sailed upon the surface of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      London at the end of the 19th century consumed vast quantities of a soft
      bituminous coal for the purpose of heating rooms and of preparing food. In
      the morning and during the day, clouds of black smoke were poured forth
      from thousands of chimneys. When a mass of white vapor arose in the night
      these clouds of smoke fell upon the fog, pressing it down, filtering
      slowly through it, and adding to its density. The sun would have absorbed
      the fog but for the layer of smoke that lay thick above the vapor and
      prevented the rays reaching it. Once this condition of things prevailed,
      nothing could clear London but a breeze of wind from any direction. London
      frequently had a seven days&rsquo; fog, and sometimes a seven days&rsquo;
      calm, but these two conditions never coincided until the last year of the
      last century. The coincidence, as everyone knows, meant death&mdash;death
      so wholesale that no war the earth has ever seen left such slaughter
      behind it. To understand the situation, one has only to imagine the fog as
      taking the place of the ashes at Pompeii, and the coal-smoke as being the
      lava that covered it. The result to the inhabitants in both cases was
      exactly the same.

    <h2>
      THE AMERICAN WHO WANTED TO SELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was at the time confidential clerk to the house of Fulton, Brixton &amp;
      Co., a firm in Cannon Street, dealing largely in chemicals and chemical
      apparatus. Fulton I never knew; he died long before my time. Sir John
      Brixton was my chief, knighted, I believe, for services to his party, or
      because he was an official in the City during some royal progress through
      it; I have forgotten which. My small room was next to his large one, and
      my chief duty was to see that no one had an interview with Sir John unless
      he was an important man or had important business. Sir John was a
      difficult man to see, and a difficult man to deal with when he was seen.
      He had little respect for most men&rsquo;s feelings, and none at all for
      mine. If I allowed a man to enter his room who should have been dealt with
      by one of the minor members of the company, Sir John made no effort to
      conceal his opinion of me. One day, in the autumn of the last year of the
      century, an American was shown into my room. Nothing would do but he must
      have an interview with Sir John Brixton. I told him that it was
      impossible, as Sir John was extremely busy, but that if he explained his
      business to me I would lay it before Sir John at the first favorable
      opportunity. The American demurred at this, but finally accepted the
      inevitable. He was the inventor, he said, of a machine that would
      revolutionize life in London, and he wanted Fulton, Brixton &amp; Co. to
      become agents for it. The machine, which he had in a small handbag with
      him, was of white metal, and it was so constructed that by turning an
      index it gave out greater or less volumes of oxygen gas. The gas, I
      understood, was stored in the interior in liquid form under great
      pressure, and would last, if I remember rightly, for six months without
      recharging. There was also a rubber tube with a mouthpiece attached to it,
      and the American said that if a man took a few whiffs a day, he would
      experience beneficial results. Now, I knew there was not the slightest use
      in showing the machine to Sir John, because we dealt in old-established
      British apparatus, and never in any of the new- fangled Yankee
      contraptions. Besides, Sir John had a prejudice against Americans, and I
      felt sure this man would exasperate him, as he was a most cadaverous
      specimen of the race, with high nasal tones, and a most deplorable
      pronunciation, much given to phrases savoring of slang; and he exhibited
      also a certain nervous familiarity of demeanor towards people to whom he
      was all but a complete stranger. It was impossible for me to allow such a
      man to enter the presence of Sir John Brixton, and when he returned some
      days later I explained to him, I hope with courtesy, that the head of the
      house regretted very much his inability to consider his proposal regarding
      the machine. The ardor of the American seemed in no way dampened by this
      rebuff. He said I could not have explained the possibilities of the
      apparatus properly to Sir John; he characterized it as a great invention,
      and said it meant a fortune to whoever obtained the agency for it. He
      hinted that other noted London houses were anxious to secure it, but for
      some reason not stated he preferred to deal with us. He left some printed
      pamphlets referring to the invention, and said he would call again.

    <h2>
      THE AMERICAN SEES SIR JOHN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many a time I have since thought of that persistent American, and wondered
      whether he left London before the disaster, or was one of the unidentified
      thousands who were buried in unmarked graves. Little did Sir John think
      when he expelled him with some asperity from his presence, that he was
      turning away an offer of life, and that the heated words he used were, in
      reality, a sentence of death upon himself. For my own part, I regret that
      I lost my temper, and told the American his business methods did not
      commend themselves to me. Perhaps he did not feel the sting of this;
      indeed, I feel certain he did not, for, unknowingly, he saved my life. Be
      that as it may, he showed no resentment, but immediately asked me out to
      drink with him, an offer I was compelled to refuse. But I am getting ahead
      of my story. Indeed, being unaccustomed to writing, it is difficult for me
      to set down events in their proper sequence. The American called upon me
      several times after I told him our house could not deal with him. He got
      into the habit of dropping in upon me unannounced, which I did not at all
      like, but I gave no instructions regarding his intrusions, because I had
      no idea of the extremes to which he was evidently prepared to go. One day,
      as he sat near my desk reading a paper, I was temporarily called from the
      room. When I returned I thought he had gone, taking his machine with him,
      but a moment later I was shocked to hear his high nasal tones in Sir John&rsquo;s
      room alternating with the deep notes of my chief&rsquo;s voice, which
      apparently exercised no such dread upon the American as upon those who
      were more accustomed to them. I at once entered the room, and was about to
      explain to Sir John that the American was there through no connivance of
      mine, when my chief asked me to be silent, and, turning to his visitor,
      gruffly requested him to proceed with his interesting narration. The
      inventor needed no second invitation, but went on with his glib talk,
      while Sir John&rsquo;s frown grew deeper, and his face became redder under
      his fringe of white hair. When the American had finished, Sir John roughly
      bade him begone, and take his accursed machine with him. He said it was an
      insult for a person with one foot in the grave to bring a so-called health
      invention to a robust man who never had a day&rsquo;s illness, I do not
      know why he listened so long to the American, when he had made up his mind
      from the first not to deal with him, unless it was to punish me for
      inadvertently allowing the stranger to enter. The interview distressed me
      exceedingly, as I stood there helpless, knowing Sir John was becoming more
      and more angry with every word the foreigner uttered, but, at last, I
      succeeded in drawing the inventor and his work into my own room and
      closing the door. I sincerely hoped I would never see the American again,
      and my wish was gratified. He insisted on setting his machine going, and
      placing it on a shelf in my room. He asked me to slip it into Sir John&rsquo;s
      room some foggy day and note the effect. The man said he would call again,
      but he never did.

    <h2>
      HOW THE SMOKE HELD DOWN THE FOG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on a Friday that the fog came down upon us. The weather was very
      fine up to the middle of November that autumn. The fog did not seem to
      have anything unusual about it. I have seen many worse fogs than that
      appeared to be. As day followed day, however, the atmosphere became denser
      and darker, caused, I suppose, by the increasing volume of coal- smoke
      poured out upon it. The peculiarity about those seven days was the intense
      stillness of the air. We were, although we did not know it, under an
      air-proof canopy, and were slowly but surely exhausting the life-giving
      oxygen around us, and replacing it by poisonous carbonic acid gas.
      Scientific men have since showed that a simple mathematical calculation
      might have told us exactly when the last atom of oxygen would have been
      consumed; but it is easy to be wise after the event. The body of the
      greatest mathematician in England was found in the Strand. He came that
      morning from Cambridge. During the fog there was always a marked increase
      in the death rate, and on this occasion the increase was no greater than
      usual until the sixth day. The newspapers on the morning of the seventh
      were full of startling statistics, but at the time of going to press the
      full significance of the alarming figures was not realized. The editorials
      of the morning papers on the seventh day contained no warning of the
      calamity that was so speedily to follow their appearance. I lived then at
      Ealing, a Western suburb of London, and came every morning to Cannon
      Street by a certain train. I had up to the sixth day experienced no
      inconvenience from the fog, and this was largely due, I am convinced, to
      the unnoticed operations of the American machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth and sixth days Sir John did not come to the City, but he was
      in his office on the seventh. The door between his room and mine was
      closed. Shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock I heard a cry in his room,
      followed by a heavy fall. I opened the door, and saw Sir John lying face
      downwards on the floor. Hastening towards him, I felt for the first time
      the deadly effect of the deoxygenized atmosphere, and before I reached him
      I fell first on one knee and then headlong. I realized that my senses were
      leaving me, and instinctively crawled back to my own room, where the
      oppression was at once lifted, and I stood again upon my feet, gasping. I
      closed the door of Sir John&rsquo;s room, thinking it filled with
      poisonous fumes, as, indeed, it was. I called loudly for help, but there
      was no answer. On opening the door to the main office I met again what I
      thought was the noxious vapor. Speedily as I closed the door, I was
      impressed by the intense silence of the usually busy office, and saw that
      some of the clerks were motionless on the floor, and others sat with their
      heads on their desks as if asleep. Even at this awful moment I did not
      realize that what I saw was common to all London, and not, as I imagined,
      a local disaster, caused by the breaking of some carboys in our cellar.
      (It was filled with chemicals of every kind, of whose properties I was
      ignorant, dealing as I did with the accountant, and not the scientific
      side of our business.) I opened the only window in my room, and again
      shouted for help. The street was silent and dark in the ominously still
      fog, and what now froze me with horror was meeting the same deadly,
      stifling atmosphere that was in the rooms. In falling I brought down the
      window, and shut out the poisonous air. Again I revived, and slowly the
      true state of things began to dawn upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in an oasis of oxygen. I at once surmised that the machine on my
      shelf was responsible for the existence of this oasis in a vast desert of
      deadly gas. I took down the American&rsquo;s machine, fearful in moving it
      that I might stop its working. Taking the mouthpiece between my lips I
      again entered Sir John&rsquo;s room, this time without feeling any ill
      effects. My poor master was long beyond human help. There was evidently no
      one alive in the building except myself. Out in the street all was silent
      and dark. The gas was extinguished, but here and there in shops the
      incandescent lights were still weirdly burning, depending, as they did, on
      accumulators, and not on direct engine power. I turned automatically
      towards Cannon Street Station, knowing my way to it even if blindfolded,
      stumbling over bodies prone on the pavement, and in crossing the street I
      ran against a motionless &lsquo;bus, spectral in the fog, with dead horses
      lying in front, and their reins dangling from the nerveless hand of a dead
      driver. The ghostlike passengers, equally silent, sat bolt upright, or
      hung over the edge boards in attitudes horribly grotesque.

    <h2>
      THE TRAIN WITH ITS TRAIL OF THE DEAD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If a man&rsquo;s reasoning faculties were alert at such a time (I confess
      mine were dormant), he would have known there could be no trains at Cannon
      Street Station, for if there was not enough oxygen in the air to keep a
      man alive, or a gas-jet alight, there would certainly not be enough to
      enable an engine fire to burn, even if the engineer retained sufficient
      energy to attend to his task. At times instinct is better than reason, and
      it proved so in this case. The railway from Ealing in those days came
      under the City in a deep tunnel. It would appear that in this underground
      passage the carbonic acid gas would first find a resting-place on account
      of its weight; but such was not the fact. I imagine that a current through
      the tunnel brought from the outlying districts a supply of comparatively
      pure air that, for some minutes after the general disaster, maintained
      human life. Be this as it may, the long platforms of Cannon Street
      Underground Station presented a fearful spectacle. A train stood at the
      down platform. The electric lights burned fitfully. This platform was
      crowded with men, who fought each other like demons, apparently for no
      reason, because the train was already packed as full as it could hold.
      Hundreds were dead under foot, and every now and then a blast of foul air
      came along the tunnel, whereupon hundreds more would relax their grips,
      and succumb. Over their bodies the survivors fought, with continually
      thinning ranks. It seemed to me that most of those in the standing train
      were dead. Sometimes a desperate body of fighters climbed over those lying
      in heaps and, throwing open a carriage door, hauled out passengers already
      in, and took their places, gasping. Those in the train offered no
      resistance, and lay motionless where they were flung, or rolled helplessly
      under the wheels of the train. I made my way along the wall as well as I
      could to the engine, wondering why the train did not go. The engineer lay
      on the floor of his cab, and the fires were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom is a curious thing. The struggling mob, fighting wildly for places
      in the carriages, were so accustomed to trains arriving and departing that
      it apparently occurred to none of them that the engineer was human and
      subject to the same atmospheric conditions as themselves. I placed the
      mouthpiece between his purple lips, and, holding my own breath like a
      submerged man, succeeded in reviving him. He said that if I gave him the
      machine he would take out the train as far as the steam already in the
      boiler would carry it. I refused to do this, but stepped on the engine
      with him, saying it would keep life in both of us until we got out into
      better air. In a surly manner he agreed to this and started the train, but
      he did not play fair. Each time he refused to give up the machine until I
      was in a fainting condition with holding in my breath, and, finally, he
      felled me to the floor of the cab. I imagine that the machine rolled off
      the train as I fell and that he jumped after it. The remarkable thing is
      that neither of us needed the machine, for I remember that just after we
      started I noticed through the open iron door that the engine fire suddenly
      became aglow again, although at the time I was in too great a state of
      bewilderment and horror to understand what it meant. A western gale had
      sprung up&mdash;an hour too late. Even before we left Cannon Street those
      who still survived were comparatively safe, for one hundred and
      sixty-seven persons were rescued from that fearful heap of dead on the
      platforms, although many died within a day or two after, and others never
      recovered their reason. When I regained my senses after the blow dealt by
      the engineer, I found myself alone, and the train speeding across the
      Thames near Kew. I tried to stop the engine, but did not succeed. However,
      in experimenting, I managed to turn on the air brake, which in some degree
      checked the train, and lessened the impact when the crash came at Richmond
      terminus. I sprang off on the platform before the engine reached the
      terminal buffers, and saw passing me like a nightmare the ghastly
      trainload of the dead. Most of the doors were swinging open, and every
      compartment was jammed full, although, as I afterwards learned, at each
      curve of the permanent way, or extra lurch of the train, bodies had fallen
      out all along the line. The smash at Richmond made no difference to the
      passengers. Besides myself, only two persons were taken alive from the
      train, and one of these, his clothes torn from his back in the struggle
      was sent to an asylum, where he was never able to tell who he was;
      neither, as far as I know, did anyone ever claim him.

    <h2>
      THE PREDICAMENT OF DE PLONVILLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This story differs from others in having an assortment of morals. Most
      stories have one moral; here are several. The moral usually appears at the
      end&mdash;in this case a few are mentioned at the beginning, so that they
      may be looked out for as the reading progresses. First: it is well for a
      man&mdash;especially a young man&mdash;to attend to his own business.
      Second: in planning a person&rsquo;s life for some little distance ahead,
      it will be a mistake if an allowance of ten per cent. at least, is not
      made for that unknown quantity&mdash;woman. Third: it is beneficial to
      remember that one man rarely knows everything. Other morals will doubtless
      present themselves, and at the end the cynically-inclined person may
      reflect upon the adage about the frying-pan and the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young M. de Plonville of Paris enjoyed a most enviable position. He had
      all the money he needed, which is quite a different thing from saying he
      had all the money he wanted. He was well educated, and spoke three
      languages, that is, he spoke his own well and the other two badly, but as
      a man always prides himself on what he is least able to do, De Plonville
      fancied himself a linguist. His courage in speaking English to Englishmen
      and German to Germans showed that he was, at least, a brave man. There was
      a great deal of good and even of talent in De Plonville. This statement is
      made at the beginning, because everyone who knows De Plonville will at
      once unhesitatingly contradict it. His acquaintances thought him one of
      the most objectionable young men in Paris, and naval officers, when his
      name was mentioned, usually gave themselves over to strong and
      unjustifiable language. This was all on account of De Plonville&rsquo;s
      position, which, although enviable had its drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rank in the navy was such that it entitled him to no consideration
      whatever, but, unfortunately for his own popularity, De Plonville had a
      method of giving force to his suggestions. His father was a very big man
      in the French Government. He was so big a man that he could send a censure
      to the commander of a squadron in the navy, and the commander dare not
      talk back. It takes a very big man indeed to do this, and that was the
      elder De Plonville&rsquo;s size. But then it was well known that the elder
      De Plonville was an easy-going man who loved comfort, and did not care to
      trouble himself too much about the navy in his charge, and so when there
      was trouble, young De Plonville got the credit of it; consequently, the
      love of the officers did not flow out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often young De Plonville&rsquo;s idiotic impetuosity gave color to these
      suspicions. For instance, there is the well-known Toulon incident. In a
      heated controversy young De Plonville had claimed that the firing of the
      French ironclads was something execrable, and that the whole fleet could
      not hold their own at the cannon with any ten of the British navy. Some
      time after, the naval officers learned that the Government at Paris was
      very much displeased with the inaccurate gun practice of the fleet, and
      the hope was expressed that the commander would see his way to improving
      it. Of course, the officers could do nothing but gnash their teeth, try to
      shoot better, and hope for a time to come when the Government then in
      power would be out, and they could find some tangible pretence for hanging
      young De Plonville from the yard-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this has only a remote bearing upon this story, but we now come to a
      matter on which the story sinks or swims. De Plonville had a secret&mdash;
      not such a secret as is common in Parisian life, but one entirely
      creditable to him. It related to an invention intended to increase the
      efficiency of the French army. The army being a branch of the defences of
      his country with which De Plonville had nothing whatever to do, his
      attention naturally turned towards it. He spoke of this invention, once,
      to a friend, a lieutenant in the army. He expected to get some practical
      suggestions. He never mentioned it again to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is based on the principle of the umbrella,&rdquo; he said to his
      friend; &ldquo;in fact, it was the umbrella that suggested it to me. If it
      could be made very light so as not to add seriously to the impedimenta at
      present carried by the soldier, it seems to me it would be exceedingly
      useful. Instead of being circular as an umbrella is, it must be oblong
      with sharp ends. It would have to be arranged so as to be opened and
      closed quickly, with the cloth thin, but impervious to water. When the
      army reached a river each soldier could open this, place it in the water,
      enter it with some care, and then paddle himself across with the butt-end
      of his gun, or even with a light paddle, if the carrying of it added but
      little to the weight, thus saving the building of temporary bridges. It
      seems to me such an invention ought to be of vast use in a forced march.
      Then at night it might be used as a sort of tent, or in a heavy rain it
      would form a temporary shelter. What do you think of the idea?&rdquo; His
      friend had listened with half-closed eyes. He blew a whiff of cigarette
      smoke from his nostrils and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful, De Plonville,&rdquo; he said drawlingly. &ldquo;Its
      possibilities are vast&mdash;more so than even you appear to think. It
      would be very useful in our Alpine corps as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so. But why there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, if the army reached a high peak looking into a deep
      valley, only to be reached over an inaccessible precipice, all the army
      would have to do would be to spread out your superb invention and use it
      as a parachute. The sight of the army of France gradually floating down
      into the valley would be so terrifying to the nations of Europe, that I
      imagine no enemy would wait for a gun to be fired. De Plonville, your
      invention will immortalize you, and immortalize the French army.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young De Plonville waited to hear no more, but turned on his heel and
      strode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation caused young De Plonville to make two resolutions;
      first, to mention his scheme to no one; second, to persevere and perfect
      his invention, thus causing confusion to the scoffer. There were several
      sub-resolutions dependent on these two. He would not enter a club, he
      would abjure society, he would not speak to a woman&mdash;he would, in
      short, be a hermit until his invention stood revealed before an astonished
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which goes to show that young De Plonville was not the conceited,
      meddlesome fop his acquaintances thought him. But in the large and small
      resolutions he did not deduct the ten per cent. for the unknown quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where? That was the question. De Plonville walked up and down his room,
      and thought it out. A large map of France was spread on the table. Paris
      and the environs thereof were manifestly impossible. He needed a place of
      seclusion. He needed a stretch of water. Where then should be the spot to
      which coming generations would point and say, &ldquo;Here, at this place,
      was perfected De Plonville&rsquo;s celebrated parachute-tent- bateau
      invention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not parachute. Hang the parachute! That was the scoffing lieutenant&rsquo;s
      word. De Plonville paused for a moment to revile his folly in making a
      confidant of any army man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sufficiency of water around the French coast, but it was too
      cold at that season of the year to experiment in the north and east. There
      was left the Mediterranean. He thought rapidly of the different delightful
      spots along the Riviera&mdash;Cannes, St. Raphael, Nice, Monte Carlo,&mdash;but
      all of these were too public and too much thronged with visitors. The name
      of the place came to him suddenly, and, as he stopped his march to and
      fro, De Plonville wondered why it had not suggested itself to him at the
      very first. Hyères! It seemed to have been planned in the Middle Ages for
      the perfecting of just such an invention. It was situated two or three
      miles back from the sea, the climate was perfect, there was no marine
      parade, the sea coast was lonely, and the bay sheltered by the islands. It
      was an ideal spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Plonville easily secured leave of absence. Sons of fathers high up in
      the service of a grateful country seldom have any difficulty about a
      little thing like that. He purchased a ticket for that leisurely train
      which the French with their delicious sense of humor call the &ldquo;Rapide,&rdquo;
      and in due time found himself with his various belongings standing on the
      station platform at Hyères.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of us are as brave as we think ourselves. De Plonville flinched when
      the supreme moment came, and perhaps that is why the Gods punished him. He
      had resolved to go to one of the country inns at Carqueyranne on the
      coast, but this was in a heroic mood when the lieutenant had laughed at
      his project. Now in a cooler moment he thought of the cuisine of
      Carqueyranne and shuddered. There are sacrifices which no man should be
      called upon to endure, so the naval officer hesitated, and at last
      directed the porter to put his luggage on the top of the Costebelle Hotel
      &ldquo;bus.&rdquo; There would be society at the hotel it is true, but he
      could avoid it, while if he went to the rural tavern he could not avoid
      the cooking. Thus he smothered his conscience. Lunch at Costebelle seemed
      to justify his choice of an abiding-place. The surroundings of the hotel
      were dangerously charming to a man whose natural inclination was towards
      indolent enjoyment. It was a place to &ldquo;Loaf and invite your soul,&rdquo;
      as Walt Whitman phrases it. Plonville, who was there incognito, for he had
      temporarily dropped the &ldquo;De,&rdquo; strolled towards the sea in the
      afternoon, with the air of one who has nothing on his mind. No one to see
      him would have suspected he was the future Edison of France. When he
      reached the coast at the ruins of the ancient Roman naval station called
      Pomponiana, he smote his thigh with joy. He had forgotten that at this
      spot there had been erected a number of little wooden houses, each larger
      than a bathing-machine and smaller than a cottage, which were used in
      summer by the good people of Hyères, and in winter were silently vacant.
      The largest of these would be exactly the place for him, and he knew he
      would have no difficulty in renting it for a month or two. Here, he could
      bring down his half- finished invention; here, work at it all day
      unmolested; and here test its sailing qualities with no onlookers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up the road, and hailed the ancient bus which jogs along between
      Toulon and Hyères by way of the coast; mounted beside the driver, and
      speedily got information about the owner of the cottages at Pomponiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he expected, he had no difficulty in arranging with the proprietor for
      the largest of the little cottages, but he thought he detected a slight
      depression on the right eyelid as that person handed him the key. Had the
      owner suspected his purpose? he asked himself anxiously, as he drove back
      from the town to Costebelle. Impossible. He felt, however, that he could
      not be too secret about his intentions. He had heard of inventors being
      forestalled just at the very moment of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade the driver wait, and placed that part of his luggage in the cab
      which consisted of his half-finished invention and the materials for
      completing it. Then he drove to the coast, and after placing the packages
      on the ground, paid and dismissed the man. When the cab was out of sight,
      he carried the things to the cottage and locked them in. His walk up the
      hill to the hotel rendered the excellent dinner provided doubly
      attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he was early at work, and speedily began to realize how many
      necessary articles he had forgotten at Paris. He hoped he would be able to
      get them at Hyères, but his remembrance of the limited resources of the
      town made him somewhat doubtful. The small windows on each side gave him
      scarcely enough light, but he did not open the door, fearing the curiosity
      of a chance passer-by. One cannot be too careful in maturing a great
      invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plonville had been at work for possibly an hour and a half, when he heard
      someone singing, and that very sweetly. She sang with the joyous freedom
      of one who suspected no listener. The song came nearer and nearer.
      Plonville standing amazed, dropped his implements, and stole to the
      somewhat obscure little window. He saw a vision of fresh loveliness
      dressed in a costume he never before beheld on a vision. She came down the
      bank with a light, springy step to the next cottage, took a key that hung
      at her belt, and threw open the door. The song was hushed, but not
      silenced, for a moment, and then there came from out the cottage door the
      half of a boat that made Plonville gasp. Like the costume, he had never
      before seen such a boat. It was exactly the shape in which he had designed
      his invention, and was of some extra light material, for the sylph-like
      girl in the extraordinary dress pushed it forth without even ceasing her
      song. Next moment, she came out herself and stood there while she adjusted
      her red head-gear. She drew the boat down to the water, picked out of it a
      light, silver-mounted paddle, stepped deftly aboard, and settled down to
      her place with the airy grace of a thistle-down. There was no seat in the
      boat, Plonville noted with astonishment. The sea was very smooth, and a
      few strokes of the paddle sent girl and craft out of sight along the
      coast. Plonville drew a deep breath of bewilderment. It was his first
      sight of a Thames boating costume and a canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was why the man winked when he gave him the key. Plonville was
      in a quandary. Should he reveal himself when she returned? It did not seem
      to be quite the thing to allow the girl to believe she had the coast to
      herself when in fact she hadn&rsquo;t. But then there was his invention to
      think of. He had sworn allegiance to that. He sat down and pondered.
      English, evidently. He had no idea English girls were so pretty, and then
      that costume! It was <i>very</i> taking. The rich, creamy folds of the
      white flannel, so simple, yet so complete, lingered in his memory. Still,
      what was he there for? His invention certainly. The sneer of the
      lieutenant stung his memory. That Miss Whatever-her- name-might-be had
      rented the next box was nothing to him; of course not. He waved her aside
      and turned to his work. He had lost enough of time as it was; he would
      lose no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although armed with this heroic resolution, his task somehow did not seem
      so interesting as before, and he found himself listening now and then for
      the siren&rsquo;s song. He dramatized imaginary situations, which is
      always bad for practical work. He saw the frail craft shattered or
      overturned, and beheld himself bravely buffeting the waves rescuing the
      fair girl in white. Then he remembered with a sigh that he was not a good
      swimmer. Possibly she was more at home in the waves than he was. Those
      English seemed on such terms of comradeship with the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, intuition rather than hearing told him she had returned. He
      walked on tip-toe to the dingy window. She was pulling the light canoe up
      from the water. He checked his impulse to offer assistance. When the girl
      sprang lightly up the bank, Plonville sighed and concluded he had done
      enough work for the day. As he reached the road, he noticed that the white
      figure in the distance did not take the way to the hotel, but towards one
      of the neighboring Chateaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, Plonville worked long at his invention, and made
      progress. He walked back to his hotel with the feeling of self-
      satisfaction which indolent men have on those rare occasions when they are
      industrious. He had been uninterrupted, and his resolutions were again
      heroic. What had been done one afternoon might be done all afternoons. He
      would think no more of the vision he had seen and he would work only after
      lunch, thus avoiding the necessity of revealing himself, or of being a
      concealed watcher of her actions. Of course she came always in the
      morning, for the English are a methodical people, and Plonville was so
      learned in their ways that he knew what they did one day they were sure to
      do the next. An extraordinary nation, Plonville said to himself with a
      shrug of his shoulders, but then of course, we cannot all be French.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is rather a pity that temptation should step in just when a man has
      made up his mind not to deviate from a certain straight line of conduct.
      There was to be a ball that night at the big hotel. Plonville had refused
      to have anything to do with it. He had renounced the frivolities of life.
      He was there for rest, quiet, and study. He was adamant. That evening the
      invitation was again extended to him, the truth being that there was a
      scarcity of young men, as is usually the case at such functions. Plonville
      was about to re-state his objections to frivolity when through the open
      door he caught a glimpse of two of the arriving guests ascending the
      stair. The girl had on a long opera cloak with some fluffy white material
      round the neck and down the front. A filmy lace arrangement rested lightly
      on her fair hair. It was the lady of the canoe&mdash;glorified. Plonville
      wavered and was lost. He rushed to his room and donned his war paint. Say
      what you like, evening dress improves the appearance of a man. Besides
      this, he had resumed the De once more, and his back was naturally
      straighter. De Plonville looked well.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were speedily introduced, of course. De Plonville took care of that,
      and the manager of the ball was very grateful to him for coming, and for
      looking so nice. There was actually an air of distinction about De
      Plonville. She was the Hon. Margaret Stansby, he learned. Besides being
      unfair, it would be impossible to give their conversation. It would read
      like a section from Ollendorf&rsquo;s French-English exercises. De
      Plonville, as has been said, was very proud of his English, and,
      unfortunately, the Hon. Margaret had a sense of humor. He complimented her
      by saying that she talked French even better than he talked English,
      which, while doubtless true, was not the most tactful thing De Plonville
      might have said. It was difficult to listen to such a statement given in
      his English, and refrain from laughing. Margaret, however, scored a great
      victory and did not laugh. The evening passed pleasantly, she thought;
      delightfully, De Plonville thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard after this to come down to the prosaic work of completing a
      cloth canoe-tent, but, to De Plonville&rsquo;s credit, he persevered. He
      met the young lady on several occasions, but never by the coast. The
      better they became acquainted the more he wished to have the privilege of
      rescuing her from some deadly danger; but the opportunity did not come. It
      seldom does, except in books, as he bitterly remarked to himself. The sea
      was exasperatingly calm, and Miss Margaret was mistress of her craft, as
      so many charming women are. He thought of buying a telescope and watching
      her, for she had told him that one of her own delights was looking at the
      evolutions of the ironclads through a telescope on the terrace in front of
      the Chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in spite of his distractions, De Plonville added the finishing
      touches to his notable invention, and all that remained was to put it to a
      practical test. He chose a day when that portion of the French navy which
      frequents the Rade d&rsquo;Hyères was not in sight, for he did not wish to
      come within the field of the telescope at the Chateau terrace. He felt
      that he would not look his best as he paddled his new-fangled boat.
      Besides, it might sink with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sail in sight as he put forth. Even the fishing boats of
      Carqueyranne were in shelter. The sea was very calm, and the sun shone
      brightly. He had some little difficulty in getting seated, but he was
      elated to find that his invention answered all expectations. As he went
      further out he noticed a great buoy floating a long distance away. His
      evil genius suggested that it would be a good thing to paddle out to the
      buoy and back. Many men can drink champagne and show no sign, but few can
      drink success and remain sober. The eccentric airs assumed by noted
      authors prove the truth of this. De Plonville was drunk, and never
      suspected it. The tide, what little there is of it in the Mediterranean,
      helped him, and even the gentle breeze blew from the shore. He had some
      doubts as to the wisdom of his course before he reached the gigantic red
      buoy, but when he turned around and saw the appalling distance to the
      coast, he shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great buoy was of iron, apparently boiler plate, and there were rings
      fastened to its side. It was pear-shaped with the point in the water,
      fastened to a chain that evidently led to an anchor. He wondered what it
      was for. As he looked up it was moved by some unseen current, and rolled
      over as if bent on the destruction of his craft. Forgetting himself, he
      sprang up to ward it off, and instantly one foot went through the thin
      waterproof that formed the bottom and sides of his boat. He found himself
      struggling in the water almost before he realized what had happened.
      Kicking his foot free from the entanglement that threatened to drag him
      under, he saw his invention slowly settle down through the clear, green
      water. He grasped one of the rings of the buoy, and hung there for a
      moment to catch his breath and consider his position. He rapidly came to
      the conclusion that it was not a pleasant one, but further than that he
      found it difficult to go. Attempting to swim ashore would be simply one
      form of suicide. The thing to do was evidently to get on top of the buoy,
      but he realized that if he tried to pull himself up by the rings it would
      simply roll him under. He was surprised to find, however, that such was
      not the case. He had under- estimated both its size and its weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on top of it and breathed heavily after his exertions, gazing
      for a few moments at the vast expanse of shimmering blue water. It was
      pretty, but discouraging. Not even a fishing-boat was in sight, and he was
      in a position where every prospect pleases, and only man is in a vile
      situation. The big iron island had an uncomfortable habit every now and
      then of lounging partly over to one side or the other, so that De
      Plonville had to scramble this way or that to keep from falling off. He
      vaguely surmised that his motions on these occasions lacked dignity. The
      hot sun began to dry the clothes on his back, and he felt his hair become
      crisp with salt. He recollected that swimming should be easy here, for he
      was on the saltest portion of the saltest open sea in the world. Then his
      gaze wandered over the flat lands about Les Salins where acres of ground
      were covered artificially with Mediterranean water so that the sun may
      evaporate it, and leave the coarse salt used by the fishermen of the
      coast. He did not yet feel hungry, but he thought with regret of the good
      dinner which would be spread at the hotel that evening, when, perhaps, he
      would not be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned himself around and scanned the distant Islands of Gold, but
      there was as little prospect of help from that quarter as from the
      mainland. Becoming more accustomed to the swayings of the big globe, he
      stood up. What a fool he had been to come so far, and he used French words
      between his teeth that sounded terse and emphatic. Still there was little
      use thinking of that. Here he was, and here he would stay, as a President
      of his country had once remarked. The irksomeness and restraint of his
      position began to wear on his nerves, and he cried aloud for something&mdash;anything&mdash;to
      happen rather than what he was enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      From between the Islands, there slowly appeared a great modern French ship
      of war, small in the distance. Hope lighted up the face of De Plonville.
      She must pass near enough to enable his signalling to be seen by the
      lookout. Heavens! how leisurely she moved! Then a second war vessel
      followed the first into view, and finally a third. The three came slowly
      along in stately procession. De Plonville removed his coat and waved it up
      and down to attract attention. So intent was he upon this that he nearly
      lost his footing, and, realizing that the men-of- war were still too far
      away, he desisted. He sat down as his excitement abated, and watched their
      quiet approach. Once it seemed to him they had stopped, and he leaned
      forward, shading his eyes with his hand, and watched them eagerly. They
      were just moving&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, from the black side of the foremost battle-ship, there rolled
      upward a cloud of white smoke, obscuring the funnels and the rigging,
      thinning out into the blue sky over the top-masts. After what seemed a
      long interval the low, dull roar of a cannon reached him, followed by the
      echo from the high hills of the island, and later by the fainter re-echo
      from the mountains on the mainland. This depressed De Plonville, for, if
      the ships were out for practice, the obscuring smoke around them would
      make the seeing of his signalling very improbable; and then that portion
      of the fleet might return the way it came, leaving him in his predicament.
      From the second ironclad arose a similar cloud, and this time far to his
      left there spurted up from the sea a jet of water, waving in the air like
      a plume for a moment, then dropping back in a shower on the ruffled
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buoy was a target!
    </p>
    <p>
      As De Plonville realized its use, he felt that uncomfortable creeping of
      the scalp which we call, the hair standing on end. The third cannon sent
      up its cloud, and De Plonville&rsquo;s eyes extended at what they saw.
      Coming directly towards him was a cannon ball, skipping over the water
      like a thrown pebble. His experience in the navy&mdash;at Paris&mdash;had
      never taught him that such a thing was possible. He slid down flat on the
      buoy, till his chin rested on the iron, and awaited the shock. A hundred
      yards from him the ball dipped into the water and disappeared. He found
      that he had ineffectually tried to drive his nails into the boiler plate,
      until his fingers&rsquo; ends were sore. He stood up and waved his arms,
      but the first vessel fired again, and the ball came shrieking over him so
      low that he intuitively ducked his head. Like a pang of physical pain, the
      thought darted through his brain that he had instigated a censure on the
      bad firing of these very boats. Doubtless they saw a man on the buoy, but
      as no man had any business there, the knocking of him off by a cannon ball
      would be good proof of accuracy of aim. The investigation which followed
      would be a feather in the cap of the officer in charge, whatever the
      verdict. De Plonville, with something like a sigh, more than suspected
      that his untimely death would not cast irretrievable gloom over the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, a man has to die but once, and there is little use in making a fuss
      over the inevitable. He would meet his fate calmly and as a Frenchman
      should, with his face to the guns. There was a tinge of regret that there
      would be no one to witness his heroism. It is always pleasant on such
      occasions to have a war correspondent, or at least a reporter, present. It
      is best to be as comfortable as possible under any circumstances, so De
      Plonville sat down on the spheroid and let his feet dangle toward the
      water. The great buoy for some reason floated around until it presented
      its side to the ships. None of the balls came so near as those first fired&mdash;perhaps
      because of the accumulated smoke. New features of the situation continued
      to present themselves to De Plonville as he sat there. The firing had been
      going on for some time before he reflected that if a shot punctured the
      buoy it would fill and sink. Perhaps their orders were to fire until the
      buoy disappeared. There was little comfort in this suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firing had ceased for some minutes before he noticed the fact. A bank of
      thinning smoke rested on the water between the buoy and the ships. He saw
      the ironclads move ponderously around and steam through this bank turning
      broadside on again in one, two, three, order. He watched the evolution
      with his chin resting on his hands, not realizing that the moment for
      signalling had come. When the idea penetrated his somewhat dazed mind, he
      sprang to his feet, but his opportunity had gone. The smoke of the first
      gun rose in the air, there was a clang of iron on iron, and De Plonville
      found himself whirling in space: then sinking in the sea. Coming
      breathless to the surface, he saw the buoy revolving slowly, and a deep
      dinge in its side seemed to slide over its top and disappear into the
      water, showing where the shot had struck. The second boat did not fire,
      and he knew that they were examining the buoy with their glasses. He swam
      around to the other side, intending to catch a ring and have it haul him
      up where he could be seen. Before he reached the place the buoy was at
      rest again, and as he laboriously climbed on top more dead than alive, the
      second ship opened fire. He lay down at full length exhausted, and hoped
      if they were going to hit they would hit quick. Life was not worth having
      on these conditions. He felt the hot sun on his back, and listened
      dreamily to the cannon. Hope was gone, and he wondered at himself for
      feeling a remote rather than an active interest in his fate. He thought of
      himself as somebody else, and felt a vague impersonal pity. He criticised
      the random firing, and suspected the hit was merely a fluke. When his back
      was dry he rolled lazily over and lay gazing up at the cloudless sky. For
      greater comfort he placed his hands beneath his head. The sky faded, and a
      moment&rsquo;s unconsciousness intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he cried, shaking himself. &ldquo;If I
      fall asleep I shall roll off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up again, his joints stiff with his immersion, and watched the
      distant ironclads. He saw with languid interest a ball strike the water,
      take a new flight, and plunge into the sea far to the right. He thought
      that the vagaries of cannon-balls at sea would make an interesting study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you injured?&rdquo; cried a clear voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; shouted the young man in a genuine fright,
      as he sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon,&rdquo; as if a rescuer need apologize, &ldquo;I
      thought you were M. De Plonville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> De Plonville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hair is grey,&rdquo; she said in an awed whisper; then added,
      &ldquo;and no wonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the stricken young man, placing his
      hand on his heart, &ldquo;it is needless to deny&mdash;I do not deny&mdash;that
      I was frightened&mdash; but&mdash;I did not think&mdash;not so much as
      that, I regret. It is so&mdash;so&mdash; theatrical&mdash;I am deeply
      sorrowful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please say no more, but come quickly. Can you come down? Step
      exactly in the middle of the canoe. Be careful&mdash;it is easily upset&mdash;and
      sit down at once. That was very nicely done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, allow me at least to row the boat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is paddling, and you do not understand it. I do. Please do not
      speak until we are out of range. I am horribly frightened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very, very brave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hs&mdash;s&mdash;sh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stansby wielded the double-bladed paddle in a way a Red Indian might
      have envied. Once she uttered a little feminine shriek as a cannon ball
      plunged into the water behind them; but as they got further away from the
      buoy those on the iron-clads appeared to notice that a boat was within
      range, and the firing ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stansby looked fixedly at the solemn young man sitting before her;
      then placed her paddle across the canoe, bent over it, and laughed. De
      Plonville saw the reaction had come. He said sympathetically:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle, do not, I beg. All danger is over, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not frightened, don&rsquo;t think it,&rdquo; she cried,
      flashing a look of defiance at him, and forgetting her admission of fear a
      moment before. &ldquo;My father was an Admiral. I am laughing at my
      mistake. It is salt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked her astonished passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran his fingers through his hair, and the salt rattled down to the
      bottom of the canoe. There was something of relief in <i>his</i> laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      De Plonville always believes the officers on board the gunboats recognized
      him. When it was known in Paris that he was to be married to the daughter
      of an English Admiral, whom rumor said he had bravely saved from imminent
      peril, the army lieutenant remarked that she could never have heard him
      speak her language&mdash;which, as we know, is not true.

    <h2>
      A NEW EXPLOSIVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The French Minister of War sat in his very comfortable chair in his own
      private yet official room, and pondered over a letter he had received.
      Being Minister of War, he was naturally the most mild, the most humane,
      and least quarrelsome man in the Cabinet. A Minister of War receives many
      letters that, as a matter of course, he throws into his waste basket, but
      this particular communication had somehow managed to rivet his attention.
      When a man becomes Minister of War he learns for the first time that
      apparently the great majority of mankind are engaged in the manufacture or
      invention of rifles, gunpowders, and devices of all kinds for the
      destruction of the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, the Minister of War had received a letter which announced to
      him that the writer of it had invented an explosive so terrible that all
      known destructive agencies paled before it. As a Frenchman, he made the
      first offer of his discovery to the French Government. It would cost the
      Minister nothing, he said, to make a test which would corroborate his
      amazing claims for the substance, and the moment that test was made, any
      intelligent man would recognize the fact that the country which possessed
      the secret of this destructive compound would at once occupy an
      unassailable position in a contentious world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer offered personally to convince the Minister of the truth of his
      assertions, provided they could go to some remote spot where the results
      of the explosion would do no damage, and where they would be safe from
      espionage. The writer went on very frankly to say that if the Minister
      consulted with the agents of the police, they would at once see in this
      invitation a trap for the probable assassination of the Minister. But the
      inventor claimed that the Minister&rsquo;s own good sense should show him
      that his death was desired by none. He was but newly appointed, and had
      not yet had time to make enemies. France was at peace with all the world,
      and this happened before the time of the Anarchist demonstrations in
      Paris. It was but right, the letter went on, that the Minister should have
      some guarantee as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the inventor. He therefore
      gave his name and address, and said if the Minister made inquiries from
      the police, he would find nothing stood in their books against him. He was
      a student, whose attention, for years, had been given to the subject of
      explosives. To further show that he was entirely unselfish in this matter,
      he added that he had no desire to enrich himself by his discovery. He had
      a private income quite sufficient for his needs, and he intended to give,
      and not to sell, his secret to France. The only proviso he made was that
      his name should be linked with this terrible compound, which he maintained
      would secure universal peace to the world, for, after its qualities were
      known, no nation would dare to fight with another. The sole ambition of
      the inventor, said the letter in conclusion, was to place his name high in
      the list of celebrated French scientists. If, however, the Minister
      refused to treat with him he would go to other Governments until his
      invention was taken up, but the Government which secured it would at once
      occupy the leading position among nations. He entreated the Minister,
      therefore, for the sake of his country, to make at least one test of the
      compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as I have said, before the time of the Paris explosions, and
      ministers were not so suspicious then as they are now. The Minister made
      inquiries regarding the scientist, who lived in a little suburb of Paris,
      and found that there was nothing against him on the books of the police.
      Inquiry showed that all he had said about his own private fortune was
      true. The Minister therefore wrote to the inventor, and named an hour at
      which he would receive him in his private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour and the man arrived together. The Minister had had some slight
      doubts regarding his sanity, but the letter had been so straightforwardly
      written, and the appearance of the man himself was so kindly and
      benevolent and intelligent that the doubts of the official vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to be seated,&rdquo; said the Minister. &ldquo;We are
      entirely alone, and nothing you say will be heard by any one but myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Monsieur le Ministre,&rdquo; replied the inventor,
      &ldquo;for this mark of confidence; for I am afraid the claims I made in
      the letter were so extraordinary that you might well have hesitated about
      granting me an interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister smiled. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      enthusiasm of an inventor for his latest triumph, and I was enabled thus
      to take, as it were, some discount from your statements, although I doubt
      not that you have discovered something that may be of benefit to the War
      Department.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The inventor hesitated, looking seriously at the great official before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what you say,&rdquo; he began at last, &ldquo;I am rather
      afraid that my letter misled you, for, fearing it would not be credited I
      was obliged to make my claims so mild that I erred in under-estimating
      rather than in over-stating them. I have the explosive here in my pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the Minister, a shade of pallor coming over his
      countenance, as he pushed back his chair. &ldquo;I thought I stated in my
      note that you were not to bring it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for not obeying. It is perfectly harmless while in this
      state. This is one of the peculiarities&mdash;a beneficent peculiarity if
      I may so term it&mdash;of this terrible agent. It may be handled with
      perfect safety, and yet its effects are as inevitable as death,&rdquo;
      saying which, he took out of his pocket and held up to the light a bottle
      filled with a clear colorless liquid like water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could pour that on the fire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with no
      other effect than to put out the blaze. You might place it under a steam
      hammer and crush the bottle to powder, yet no explosion would follow. It
      is as harmless as water in its present condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;do you deal with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am almost afraid to tell you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if I
      could not demonstrate to your entire satisfaction that what I say is true,
      it would be folly for me to say what I am about to say. If I were to take
      this bottle and cut a notch in the cork, and walk with it neck downwards
      along the Boulevard des Italiens, allowing this fluid to fall drop by drop
      on the pavement, I could walk in that way in safety through every street
      in Paris. If it rained that day nothing would happen. If it rained the
      next or for a week nothing would happen, but the moment the sun came out
      and dried the moisture, the light step of a cat on any pavement over which
      I had passed would instantly shatter to ruins the whole of Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the Minister, an expression of horror
      coming into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would say that. Therefore I ask you to come with me to
      the country, where I can prove the truth of what I allege. While I carry
      this bottle around with me in this apparently careless fashion, it is
      corked, as you see with the utmost security. Not a drop of the fluid must
      be left on the outside of the cork or of the bottle. I have wiped the
      bottle and cork most thoroughly, and burned the cloth which I used in
      doing so. Fire will not cause this compound, even when dry, to explode,
      but the slightest touch will set it off. I have to be extremely careful in
      its manufacture, so that not a single drop is left unaccounted for in any
      place where it might evaporate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister, with his finger-tips together and his eyes on the ceiling,
      mused for a few moments on the amazing statement he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what you say is true,&rdquo; he began at last, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      you think it would be more humane to destroy all traces of the experiments
      by which you discovered this substance, and to divulge the secret to no
      one? The devastation such a thing would cause, if it fell into
      unscrupulous hands, is too appalling even to contemplate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; said the inventor; &ldquo;but some
      one else&mdash;the time may be far off or it may be near&mdash;is bound to
      make the discovery. My whole ambition, as I told you in my letter, is to
      have my name coupled with this discovery. I wish it to be known as the
      Lambelle Explosive. The secret would be safe with the French Government.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; returned the Minister. &ldquo;Some
      unscrupulous man may become Minister of War, and may use his knowledge to
      put himself in the position of Dictator. An unscrupulous man in the
      possession of such a secret would be invincible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say,&rdquo; replied the inventor, &ldquo;is undoubtedly
      true; yet I am determined that the name of Lambelle shall go down in
      history coupled with the most destructive agent the world has ever known,
      or will know. If the Government of France will build for me a large stone
      structure as secure as a fortress, I will keep my secret, but will fill
      that building with bottles like this, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;that that would
      lessen the danger, if the unscrupulous man I speak of once became
      possessed of the keys; and, besides, the mere fact that such a secret
      existed would put other inventors upon the track, and some one else less
      benevolent than yourself would undoubtedly make the discovery. You
      admitted a moment ago that the chances were a future investigator would
      succeed in getting the right ingredients together, even without the
      knowledge that such an explosive existed. See what an incentive it would
      be to inventors all over the world, if it were known that France had in
      its possession such a fearful explosive! No Government has ever yet been
      successful in keeping the secret of either a gun or a gunpowder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, of course,&rdquo; said Lambelle, &ldquo;much in what you
      say; but, equally of course, all that you say might have been said to the
      inventor of gunpowder, for gunpowder in its day was as wonderful as this
      is now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Minister laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking seriously with you on this subject,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;as if I really believed in it. Of course, I may say I do
      nothing of the kind. I think you must have hypnotized me with those calm
      eyes of yours into crediting your statements for even a few moments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I say,&rdquo; said the inventor quietly, &ldquo;can be
      corroborated to- morrow. Make an appointment with me in the country, and
      if it chances to be a calm and sunny day you will no longer doubt the
      evidence of your own eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you wish the experiment to be made?&rdquo; asked the
      Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be in some wild and desolate region, on a hill-top for
      preference. There should be either trees or old buildings there that we
      can destroy, otherwise the full effects can hardly be estimated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a place in the country,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;which
      is wild and desolate and unprofitable enough. There are some useless stone
      buildings, not on a hill-top, but by the edge of a quarry which has been
      unworked for many years. There is no habitation for several miles around.
      Would such a spot be suitable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so. When would it be convenient for you to go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave with you to-night,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;and
      we can spend the day to-morrow experimenting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Lambelle, rising when the Minister had
      told him the hour and the railway station at which they should meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when the Minister drove to the railway station in time for
      his train, he found Lambelle waiting for him, holding, by a leash, two
      sorry-looking dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you travel with such animals as these?&rdquo; asked the
      Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor brutes,&rdquo; said Lambelle, with regret in his voice,
      &ldquo;are necessary for our experiments. They will be in atoms by this
      time to- morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs were put into the railway-van, and the inventor brought his
      portmanteau with him into the private carriage reserved for the use of the
      Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place, as the Minister of War had said, was desolate enough. The stone
      buildings near the edge of the deserted quarry were stout and strong,
      although partly in ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here with me in my portmanteau,&rdquo; said Lambelle,
      &ldquo;some hundreds of metres of electric wire. I will attach one of the
      dogs by this clip, which we can release from a distance by pressing an
      electric button. The moment the dog escapes he will undoubtedly explode
      the compound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The insulated wire was run along the ground to a distant elevation. The
      dog was attached by the electric clip, and chained to a doorpost of one of
      the buildings. Lambelle then carefully uncorked his bottle, holding it at
      arm&rsquo;s length from his person. The Minister looked on with strange
      interest as Lambelle allowed the fluid to drip in a semicircular line
      around the chained dog. The inventor carefully re-corked the bottle, wiped
      it thoroughly with a cloth he had with him, and threw the cloth into one
      of the deserted houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited near, until the spots caused by the fluid on the stone
      pavement in front of the house had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the time we reach the hill,&rdquo; said Lambelle, &ldquo;it will
      be quite dry in this hot sun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they departed towards the elevation, the forlorn dog howled mournfully,
      as if in premonition of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, to make sure,&rdquo; said the inventor, when they reached
      the electrical apparatus, &ldquo;that we might wait for half an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister lit a cigarette, and smoked silently, a strange battle going
      on in his mind. He found himself believing in the extraordinary claims
      made by the inventor, and his thought dwelt on the awful possibilities of
      such an explosive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you press the electric lever?&rdquo; asked Lambelle quietly.
      &ldquo;Remember that you are inaugurating a new era.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister pressed down the key, and then, putting his field-glass to
      his eye, he saw that the dog was released, but the animal sat there
      scratching its ear with its paw. Then, realizing that it was loose, it
      sniffed for a moment at the chain. Finally, it threw up its head and
      barked, although the distance was too great for them to hear any sound.
      The dog started in the direction the two men had gone, but, before it had
      taken three steps, the Minister was appalled to see the buildings suddenly
      crumble into dust, and a few moments later the thunder of the rocks
      falling into the deserted quarry came toward them. The whole ledge had
      been flung forwards into the chasm. There was no smoke, but a haze of dust
      hovered over the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried the Minister. &ldquo;That is awful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lambelle quietly; &ldquo;I put more of the
      substance on the flagging than I need to have done. A few drops would have
      answered quite as well, but I wanted to make sure. You were very
      sceptical, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister looked at him. &ldquo;I beg of you, M. Lambelle, never to
      divulge this secret to the Government of France, or to any other power.
      Take the risk of it being discovered in the future. I implore you to
      reconsider your original intention. If you desire money, I will see that
      you get what you want from the secret funds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambelle shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire for money,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but what you
      have seen will show you that I shall be the most famous scientist of the
      century. The name of Lambelle will be known till the end of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my God, man!&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;the end of the
      world is here the moment your secret is in the possession of another. With
      you or me it would be safe: but who can tell the minds of those who may
      follow us? You are putting the power of the Almighty into the hands of a
      man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambelle flushed with pride as the pale-faced Minister said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak the truth!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is the power of
      Omnipotence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; implored the Minister, &ldquo;reconsider your
      decision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have labored too long,&rdquo; said Lambelle, &ldquo;to forego my
      triumph now. You are convinced at last, I see. Now then, tell me: will
      you, as Minister of France, secure for your country this greatest of all
      inventions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Minister; &ldquo;no other power must be
      allowed to obtain the secret. Have you ever written down the names of the
      ingredients?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered Lambelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not possible for any one to have suspected what your
      experiments were? If a man got into your laboratory&mdash;a scientific man&mdash;could
      he not, from what he saw there, obtain the secret?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible,&rdquo; said Lambelle. &ldquo;I have been
      too anxious to keep the credit for myself, to leave any traces that might
      give a hint of what I was doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wise in that,&rdquo; said the Minister, drawing a deep
      breath. &ldquo;Now let us go and look at the ruins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the spot the official&rsquo;s astonishment at the
      extraordinary destruction became greater and greater. The rock had been
      rent as if by an earthquake, to the distance of hundreds of yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;that the liquid is
      perfectly safe until evaporation takes place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; answered Lambelle. &ldquo;Of course one has to be
      careful, as I told you, in the use of it. You must not get a drop on your
      clothes, or leave it anywhere on the outside of the bottle to evaporate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambelle handed him the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any more of this in your laboratory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a drop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wished to destroy this, how would you do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should empty the bottle into the Seine. It would flow down to the
      sea, and no harm would be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if you can find any traces of the dog,&rdquo; said the
      Minister. &ldquo;I will clamber down into the quarry, and look there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find nothing,&rdquo; said Lambelle confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one path by which the bottom of the quarry could be reached.
      The Minister descended by this until he was out of sight of the man above;
      then he quickly uncorked the bottle, and allowed the fluid to drip along
      the narrowest part of the path which faced the burning sun. He corked the
      bottle, wiped it carefully with his handkerchief, which he rolled into a
      ball, and threw into the quarry. Coming up to the surface again, he said
      to the mild and benevolent scientist: &ldquo;I cannot find a trace of the
      dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I,&rdquo; said Lambelle. &ldquo;Of course when you can
      hardly find a sign of the building it is not to be expected that there
      should be any remnants of the dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we get back to the hill now and have lunch,&rdquo; said the
      Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to try another experiment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to try one more after we have had something to eat.
      What would be the effect if you poured the whole bottleful into the quarry
      and set it off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, impossible!&rdquo; cried Lambelle. &ldquo;It would rend this
      whole part of the country to pieces. In fact, I am not sure that the shock
      would not be felt as far as Paris. With a very few drops I can shatter the
      whole quarry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll try that after lunch. We have another dog left.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When an hour had passed, Lambelle was anxious to try his quarry
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-and-by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the sun will not be shining in
      the quarry, and then it will be too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can easily wait until to-morrow, unless you are in a hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in no hurry,&rdquo; rejoined the inventor. &ldquo;I thought
      perhaps you might be, with so much to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the official. &ldquo;Nothing I shall do during
      my administration will be more important than this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; answered Lambelle; &ldquo;and
      if you will give me the bottle again I will now place a few drops in the
      sunny part of the quarry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister handed him the bottle, apparently with some reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it would be much better
      to allow this secret to die. No one knows it at present but yourself. With
      you, as I have said, it will be safe, or with me; but think of the awful
      possibilities of a disclosure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every great invention has its risks,&rdquo; said Lambelle firmly.
      &ldquo;Nothing would induce me to forego the fruits of my life-work. It is
      too much to ask of any man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Minister. &ldquo;Then let us be sure of
      our facts. I want to see the effects of the explosive on the quarry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; said Lambelle, as he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait for you here,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;and
      smoke a cigarette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the inventor approached the quarry, leading the dog behind him, the
      Minister&rsquo;s hand trembled so that he was hardly able to hold the
      field-glass to his eye. Lambelle disappeared down the path. The next
      instant the ground trembled even where the Minister sat, and a haze of
      dust arose above the ruined quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some moments after the pallid Minister looked over the work of
      destruction, but no trace of humanity was there except himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not do otherwise,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;It was too
      great a risk to run.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE GREAT PEGRAM MYSTERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      (<i>With apologies to Dr. Conan Doyle, and our mutual and lamented friend
      the late Sherlock Holmes</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped in on my friend, Sherlaw Kombs, to hear what he had to say about
      the Pegram mystery, as it had come to be called in the newspapers. I found
      him playing the violin with a look of sweet peace and serenity on his
      face, which I never noticed on the countenances of those within hearing
      distance. I knew this expression of seraphic calm indicated that Kombs had
      been deeply annoyed about something. Such, indeed, proved to be the case,
      for one of the morning papers had contained an article, eulogizing the
      alertness and general competence of Scotland Yard. So great was Sherlaw
      Kombs&rsquo;s contempt for Scotland Yard that he never would visit
      Scotland during his vacations, nor would he ever admit that a Scotchman
      was fit for anything but export.
    </p>
    <p>
      He generously put away his violin, for he had a sincere liking for me, and
      greeted me with his usual kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; I began, plunging at once into the matter on my
      mind, &ldquo;to hear what you think of the great Pegram mystery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard of it,&rdquo; he said quietly, just as if all
      London were not talking of that very thing. Kombs was curiously ignorant
      on some subjects, and abnormally learned on others. I found, for instance,
      that political discussion with him was impossible, because he did not know
      who Salisbury and Gladstone were. This made his friendship a great boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pegram mystery has baffled even Gregory, of Scotland Yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; said my friend, calmly. &ldquo;Perpetual
      motion, or squaring the circle, would baffle Gregory. He&rsquo;s an
      infant, is Gregory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the things I always liked about Kombs. There was no
      professional jealousy in him, such as characterizes so many other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled his pipe, threw himself into his deep-seated arm-chair, placed
      his feet on the mantel, and clasped his hands behind his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Barrie Kipson,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;was a stockbroker in the
      City. He lived in Pegram, and it was his custom to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;COME IN!&rdquo; shouted Kombs, without changing his position, but
      with a suddenness that startled me. I had heard no knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said my friend, laughing, &ldquo;my invitation to
      enter was a trifle premature. I was really so interested in your recital
      that I spoke before I thought, which a detective should never do. The fact
      is, a man will be here in a moment who will tell me all about this crime,
      and so you will be spared further effort in that line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have an appointment. In that case I will not intrude,&rdquo;
      I said, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down; I have no appointment. I did not know until I spoke that
      he was coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at him in amazement. Accustomed as I was to his extraordinary
      talents, the man was a perpetual surprise to me. He continued to smoke
      quietly, but evidently enjoyed my consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are surprised. It is really too simple to talk about,
      but, from my position opposite the mirror, I can see the reflection of
      objects in the street. A man stopped, looked at one of my cards, and then
      glanced across the street. I recognized my card, because, as you know,
      they are all in scarlet. If, as you say, London is talking of this
      mystery, it naturally follows that <i>he</i> will talk of it, and the
      chances are he wished to consult me about it. Anyone can see that, besides
      there is always&mdash;<i>Come</i> in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rap at the door this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger entered. Sherlaw Kombs did not change his lounging attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Mr. Sherlaw Kombs, the detective,&rdquo; said the
      stranger, coming within the range of the smoker&rsquo;s vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Kombs,&rdquo; I remarked at last, as my friend smoked
      quietly, and seemed half-asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to introduce myself,&rdquo; continued the stranger,
      fumbling for a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need. You are a journalist,&rdquo; said Kombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the stranger, somewhat taken aback, &ldquo;you know
      me, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw or heard of you in my life before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing simpler. You write for an evening paper. You have written
      an article slating the book of a friend. He will feel badly about it, and
      you will condole with him. He will never know who stabbed him unless I
      tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried the journalist, sinking into a chair and
      mopping his brow, while his face became livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Kombs, &ldquo;it is a devil of a shame that
      such things are done. But what would you? as we say in France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the journalist had recovered his second wind he pulled himself
      together somewhat. &ldquo;Would you object to telling me how you know
      these particulars about a man you say you have never seen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rarely talk about these things,&rdquo; said Kombs with great
      composure. &ldquo;But as the cultivation of the habit of observation may
      help you in your profession, and thus in a remote degree benefit me by
      making your paper less deadly dull, I will tell you. Your first and second
      fingers are smeared with ink, which shows that you write a great deal.
      This smeared class embraces two sub-classes, clerks or accountants, and
      journalists. Clerks have to be neat in their work. The ink-smear is slight
      in their case. Your fingers are badly and carelessly smeared; therefore,
      you are a journalist. You have an evening paper in your pocket. Anyone
      might have any evening paper, but yours is a Special Edition, which will
      not be on the streets for half-an-hour yet. You must have obtained it
      before you left the office, and to do this you must be on the staff. A
      book notice is marked with a blue pencil. A journalist always despises
      every article in his own paper not written by himself; therefore, you
      wrote the article you have marked, and doubtless are about to send it to
      the author of the book referred to. Your paper makes a specialty of
      abusing all books not written by some member of its own staff. That the
      author is a friend of yours, I merely surmised. It is all a trivial
      example of ordinary observation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Kombs, you are the most wonderful man on earth. You are
      the equal of Gregory, by Jove, you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A frown marred the brow of my friend as he placed his pipe on the
      sideboard and drew his self-cocking six-shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult me, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not&mdash;I&mdash;I assure you. You are fit to take charge of
      Scotland Yard to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;. I am in earnest, indeed I am, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Heaven help you,&rdquo; cried Kombs, slowly raising his right
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You will spoil the
      carpet. Besides, Sherlaw, don&rsquo;t you see the man means well. He
      actually thinks it is a compliment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; remarked the detective, flinging his
      revolver carelessly beside his pipe, much to the relief of the third
      party. Then, turning to the journalist, he said, with his customary bland
      courtesy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me, I think you said. What can I do for you, Mr.
      Wilber Scribbings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kombs waved his hand impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look inside your hat if you doubt your own name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then noticed for the first time that the name was plainly to be seen
      inside the top-hat Scribbings held upside down in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard, of course, of the Pegram mystery&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush,&rdquo; cried the detective; &ldquo;do not, I beg of you, call
      it a mystery. There is no such thing. Life would become more tolerable if
      there ever <i>was</i> a mystery. Nothing is original. Everything has been
      done before. What about the Pegram affair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pegram&mdash;ah&mdash;case has baffled everyone. The <i>Evening
      Blade</i> wishes you to investigate, so that it may publish the result. It
      will pay you well. Will you accept the commission?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. Tell me about the case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought everybody knew the particulars. Mr. Barrie Kipson lived
      at Pegram. He carried a first-class season ticket between the terminus and
      that station. It was his custom to leave for Pegram on the 5.30 train each
      evening. Some weeks ago, Mr. Kipson was brought down by the influenza. On
      his first visit to the City after his recovery, he drew something like
      £300 in notes, and left the office at his usual hour to catch the 5.30. He
      was never seen again alive, as far as the public have been able to learn.
      He was found at Brewster in a first-class compartment on the Scotch
      Express, which does not stop between London and Brewster. There was a
      bullet in his head, and his money was gone, pointing plainly to murder and
      robbery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the mystery, may I ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several unexplainable things about the case. First, how
      came he on the Scotch Express, which leaves at six, and does not stop at
      Pegram? Second, the ticket examiners at the terminus would have turned him
      out if he showed his season ticket; and all the tickets sold for the
      Scotch Express on the 21st are accounted for. Third, how could the
      murderer have escaped? Fourth, the passengers in the two compartments on
      each side of the one where the body was found heard no scuffle and no shot
      fired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure the Scotch Express on the 21st did not stop between
      London and Brewster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you mention the fact, it did. It was stopped by signal
      just outside of Pegram. There was a few moments&rsquo; pause, when the
      line was reported clear, and it went on again. This frequently happens, as
      there is a branch line beyond Pegram.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sherlaw Kombs pondered for a few moments, smoking his pipe silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you wish the solution in time for to-morrow&rsquo;s
      paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, no. The editor thought if you evolved a theory in a
      month you would do well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I do not deal with theories, but with facts. If you
      can make it convenient to call here to-morrow at 8 a.m. I will give you
      the full particulars early enough for the first edition. There is no sense
      in taking up much time over so simple an affair as the Pegram case. Good
      afternoon, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scribbings was too much astonished to return the greeting. He left in
      a speechless condition, and I saw him go up the street with his hat still
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlaw Kombs relapsed into his old lounging attitude, with his hands
      clasped behind his head. The smoke came from his lips in quick puffs at
      first, then at longer intervals. I saw he was coming to a conclusion, so I
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he spoke in his most dreamy manner. &ldquo;I do not wish to seem
      to be rushing things at all, Whatson, but I am going out to-night on the
      Scotch Express. Would you care to accompany me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; I cried, glancing at the clock, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t
      time, it is after five now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ample time, Whatson&mdash;ample,&rdquo; he murmured, without
      changing his position. &ldquo;I give myself a minute and a half to change
      slippers and dressing gown for boots and coat, three seconds for hat,
      twenty-five seconds to the street, forty-two seconds waiting for a hansom,
      and then seven at the terminus before the express starts. I shall be glad
      of your company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was only too happy to have the privilege of going with him. It was most
      interesting to watch the workings of so inscrutable a mind. As we drove
      under the lofty iron roof of the terminus I noticed a look of annoyance
      pass over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are fifteen seconds ahead of our time,&rdquo; he remarked,
      looking at the big clock. &ldquo;I dislike having a miscalculation of that
      sort occur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Scotch Express stood ready for its long journey. The detective
      tapped one of the guards on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of the so-called Pegram mystery, I presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. It happened on this very train, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Is the same carriage still on the train?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, sir, it is,&rdquo; replied the guard, lowering his
      voice, &ldquo;but of course, sir, we have to keep very quiet about it.
      People wouldn&rsquo;t travel in it, else, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. Do you happen to know if anybody occupies the
      compartment in which the body was found?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady and gentleman, sir; I put &lsquo;em in myself, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you further oblige me,&rdquo; said the detective, deftly
      slipping half-a-sovereign into the hand of the guard, &ldquo;by going to
      the window and informing them in an offhand casual sort of way that the
      tragedy took place in that compartment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed the guard, and the moment he had imparted his news there was a
      suppressed scream in the carriage. Instantly a lady came out, followed by
      a florid-faced gentleman, who scowled at the guard. We entered the now
      empty compartment, and Kombs said: &ldquo;We would like to be alone here
      until we reach Brewster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to that, sir,&rdquo; answered the guard, locking the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the official moved away, I asked my friend what he expected to find
      in the carriage that would cast any light on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was his brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely to corroborate the conclusions I have already arrived at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask what those conclusions are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the detective, with a touch of lassitude
      in his voice. &ldquo;I beg to call your attention, first, to the fact that
      this train stands between two platforms, and can be entered from either
      side. Any man familiar with the station for years would be aware of that
      fact. This shows how Mr. Kipson entered the train just before it started.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the door on this side is locked,&rdquo; I objected, trying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But every season ticket-holder carries a key. This
      accounts for the guard not seeing him, and for the absence of a ticket.
      Now let me give you some information about the influenza. The patient&rsquo;s
      temperature rises several degrees above normal, and he has a fever. When
      the malady has run its course, the temperature falls to three- quarters of
      a degree below normal. These, facts are unknown to you, I imagine, because
      you are a doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I admitted such was the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the consequence of this fall in temperature is that the
      convalescent&rsquo;s mind turns toward thoughts of suicide. Then is the
      time he should be watched by his friends. Then was the time Mr. Barrie
      Kipson&rsquo;s friends did <i>not</i> watch him. You remember the 21st, of
      course. No? It was a most depressing day. Fog all around and mud under
      foot. Very good. He resolves on suicide. He wishes to be unidentified, if
      possible but forgets his season ticket. My experience is that a man about
      to commit a crime always forgets something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you account for the disappearance of the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money has nothing to do with the matter. If he was a deep man,
      and knew the stupidness of Scotland Yard, he probably sent the notes to an
      enemy. If not, they may have been given to a friend. Nothing is more
      calculated to prepare the mind for self-destruction than the prospect of a
      night ride on the Scotch Express, and the view from the windows of the
      train as it passes through the northern part of London is particularly
      conducive to thoughts of annihilation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the weapon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just the point on which I wish to satisfy myself. Excuse me
      for a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sherlaw Kombs drew down the window on the right hand side, and
      examined the top of the casing minutely with a magnifying glass. Presently
      he heaved a sigh of relief, and drew up the sash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I expected,&rdquo; he remarked, speaking more to himself
      than to me. &ldquo;There is a slight dent on the top of the window-frame.
      It is of such a nature as to be made only by the trigger of a pistol
      falling from the nerveless hand of a suicide. He intended to throw the
      weapon far out of the window, but had not the strength. It might have
      fallen into the carriage. As a matter of fact, it bounced away from the
      line and lies among the grass about ten feet six inches from the outside
      rail. The only question that now remains is where the deed was committed,
      and the exact present position of the pistol reckoned in miles from
      London, but that, fortunately, is too simple to even need explanation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens, Sherlaw!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;How can you call
      that simple? It seems to me impossible to compute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now flying over Northern London, and the great detective leaned
      back with every sign of <i>ennui</i>, closing his eyes. At last he spoke
      wearily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really too elementary, Whatson, but I am always willing to
      oblige a friend. I shall be relieved, however, when you are able to work
      out the A B C of detection for yourself, although I shall never object to
      helping you with the words of more than three syllables. Having made up
      his mind to commit suicide, Kipson naturally intended to do it before he
      reached Brewster, because tickets are again examined at that point. When
      the train began to stop at the signal near Pegram, he came to the false
      conclusion that it was stopping at Brewster. The fact that the shot was
      not heard is accounted for by the screech of the air- brake, added to the
      noise of the train. Probably the whistle was also sounding at the same
      moment. The train being a fast express would stop as near the signal as
      possible. The air-brake will stop a train in twice its own length. Call it
      three times in this case. Very well. At three times the length of this
      train from the signalpost towards London, deducting half the length of the
      train, as this carriage is in the middle, you will find the pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commonplace,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the whistle sounded shrilly, and we felt the grind of the
      air-brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pegram signal again,&rdquo; cried Kombs, with something almost
      like enthusiasm. &ldquo;This is indeed luck. We will get out here,
      Whatson, and test the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train stopped, we got out on the right-hand side of the line. The
      engine stood panting impatiently under the red light, which changed to
      green as I looked at it. As the train moved on with increasing speed, the
      detective counted the carriages, and noted down the number. It was now
      dark, with the thin crescent of the moon hanging in the western sky
      throwing a weird half-light on the shining metals. The rear lamps of the
      train disappeared around a curve, and the signal stood at baleful red
      again. The black magic of the lonesome night in that strange place
      impressed me, but the detective was a most practical man. He placed his
      back against the signal-post, and paced up the line with even strides,
      counting his steps. I walked along the permanent way beside him silently.
      At last he stopped, and took a tapeline from his pocket. He ran it out
      until the ten feet six inches were unrolled, scanning the figures in the
      wan light of the new moon. Giving me the end, he placed his knuckles on
      the metals, motioning me to proceed down the embankment. I stretched out
      the line, and then sank my hand in the damp grass to mark the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I cried, aghast, &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the pistol,&rdquo; said Kombs quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was!!

      Journalistic London will not soon forget the sensation that was caused by
      the record of the investigations of Sherlaw Kombs, as printed at length in
      the next day&rsquo;s <i>Evening Blade</i>. Would that my story ended here.
      Alas! Kombs contemptuously turned over the pistol to Scotland Yard. The
      meddlesome officials, actuated, as I always hold, by jealousy, found the
      name of the seller upon it. They investigated. The seller testified that
      it had never been in the possession of Mr. Kipson, as far as he knew. It
      was sold to a man whose description tallied with that of a criminal long
      watched by the police. He was arrested, and turned Queen&rsquo;s evidence
      in the hope of hanging his pal. It seemed that Mr. Kipson, who was a
      gloomy, taciturn man, and usually came home in a compartment by himself,
      thus escaping observation, had been murdered in the lane leading to his
      house. After robbing him, the miscreants turned their thoughts towards the
      disposal of the body&mdash;a subject that always occupies a first-class
      criminal mind before the deed is done. They agreed to place it on the
      line, and have it mangled by the Scotch Express, then nearly due. Before
      they got the body half- way up the embankment the express came along and
      stopped. The guard got out and walked along the other side to speak with
      the engineer. The thought of putting the body into an empty first-class
      carriage instantly occurred to the murderers. They opened the door with
      the deceased&rsquo;s key. It is supposed that the pistol dropped when they
      were hoisting the body in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s evidence dodge didn&rsquo;t work, and Scotland Yard
      ignobly insulted my friend Sherlaw Kombs by sending him a pass to see the
      villains hanged.

    <h2>
      DEATH COMETH SOON OR LATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Alick Robbins who named the invalid the Living Skeleton, and
      probably remorse for having thus given him a title so descriptively
      accurate, caused him to make friends with the Living Skeleton, a man who
      seemed to have no friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbins never forgot their first conversation. It happened in this way. It
      was the habit of the Living Skeleton to leave his hotel every morning
      promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock, if the sun was shining, and to shuffle
      rather than walk down the gravel street to the avenue of palms. There,
      picking out a seat on which the sun shone, the Living Skeleton would sit
      down and seem to wait patiently for someone who never came. He wore a
      shawl around his neck and a soft cloth cap on his skull. Every bone in his
      face stood out against the skin, for there seemed to be no flesh, and his
      clothes hung as loosely upon him as they would have upon a skeleton. It
      required no second glance at the Living Skeleton to know that the
      remainder of his life was numbered by days or hours, and not by weeks or
      months. He didn&rsquo;t seem to have energy enough even to read, and so it
      was that Robbins sat down one day on the bench beside him, and said
      sympathetically:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are feeling better to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Skeleton turned towards him, laughed a low, noiseless, mirthless laugh
      for a moment, and then said, in a hollow, far-away voice that had no lungs
      behind it: &ldquo;I am done with feeling either better or worse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I trust it is not so bad as that,&rdquo; said Robbins; &ldquo;the
      climate is doing you good down here, is it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Skeleton laughed silently, and Robbins began to feel uneasy. The
      Skeleton&rsquo;s eyes were large and bright, and they fastened themselves
      upon Robbins in a way that increased that gentleman&rsquo;s uneasiness,
      and made him think that perhaps the Skeleton knew he had so named him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no more interest in climate,&rdquo; said the Skeleton.
      &ldquo;I merely seem to live because I have been in the habit of living
      for some years; I presume that is it, because my lungs are entirely gone.
      Why I can talk or why I can breathe is a mystery to me. You are perfectly
      certain you can hear me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hear you quite distinctly,&rdquo; said Robbins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it wasn&rsquo;t that people tell me that they can hear me,
      I wouldn&rsquo;t believe I was really speaking, because, you see, I have
      nothing to speak with. Isn&rsquo;t it Shakespeare who says something about
      when the brains are out the man is dead? Well, I have seen some men who
      make me think Shakespeare was wrong in his diagnosis, but it is generally
      supposed that when the lungs are gone a man is dead. To tell the truth, I
      <i>am</i> dead, practically. You know the old American story about the man
      who walked around to save funeral expenses; well, it isn&rsquo;t quite
      that way with me, but I can appreciate how the man felt. Still I take a
      keen interest in life, although you might not think so. You see, I haven&rsquo;t
      much time left; I am going to die at eight o&rsquo;clock on the 30th of
      April. Eight o&rsquo;clock at night, not in the morning, just after <i>table
      d&rsquo;hôte</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to <i>what</i>!&rdquo; cried Robbins in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die that day. You see I have got things to such
      a fine point, that I can die any time I want to. I could die right here,
      now, if I wished. If you have any mortal interest in the matter I&rsquo;ll
      do it, and show you what I say is true. I don&rsquo;t mind much, you know,
      although I had fixed April the 30th as the limit. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter
      a bit for me to go off now, if it would be of any interest to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you,&rdquo; said Robbins, very much alarmed, &ldquo;not to
      try any experiments on my account. I am quite willing to believe anything
      you say about the matter&mdash;of course you ought to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do know.&rdquo; answered the Living Skeleton sadly. &ldquo;Of
      course I have had my struggle with hope and fear, but that is all past
      now, as you may well understand. The reason that I have fixed the date for
      April 30th is this: you see I have only a certain amount of money&mdash;I
      do not know why I should make any secret of it. I have exactly 240 francs
      today, over and above another 100 francs which I have set aside for
      another purpose. I am paying 8 francs a day at the Golden Dragon; that
      will keep me just thirty days, and then I intend to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Skeleton laughed again, without sound, and Robbins moved uneasily on
      the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;what there is to
      laugh about in that condition of affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there is very much; but there is something
      else that I consider very laughable, and that I will tell you if you will
      keep it a secret. You see, the Golden Dragon himself&mdash;I always call
      our innkeeper the Golden Dragon, just as you call me, the Living Skeleton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon,&rdquo; stammered Robbins,
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. You are perfectly right, and
      I think it a very apt term. Well, the old Golden Dragon makes a great deal
      of his money by robbing the dead. You didn&rsquo;t know that, did you? You
      thought it was the living who supported him, and goodness knows he robs <i>them</i>
      when he has a chance. Well, you are very much mistaken. When a man dies in
      the Golden Dragon, he, or his friends rather, have to pay very sweetly for
      it. The Dragon charges them for re-furnishing the room. Every stick of
      furniture is charged for, all the wall-paper, and so on. I suppose it is
      perfectly right to charge something, but the Dragon is not content with
      what is right. He knows he has finally lost a customer, and so he makes
      all he can out of him. The furniture so paid for, is not re-placed, and
      the walls are not papered again, but the Dragon doesn&rsquo;t abate a
      penny of his bill on that account. Now, I have inquired of the furnishing
      man, on the street back of the hotel, and he has written on his card just
      the cost of mattress, sheets, pillows, and all that sort of thing, and the
      amount comes to about 50 francs. I have put in an envelope a 50-franc
      note, and with it the card of the furniture man. I have written a letter
      to the hotel-keeper, telling him just what the things will cost that he
      needs, and have referred the Dragon to the card of the furniture man who
      has given me the figures. This envelope I have addressed to the Dragon,
      and he will find it when I am dead. This is the joke that old man Death
      and myself have put up on our host, and my only regret is that I shall not
      be able to enjoy a look at the Dragon&rsquo;s countenance as he reads my
      last letter to him. Another sum of money I have put away, in good hands
      where he won&rsquo;t have a chance to get it, for my funeral expenses, and
      then you see I am through with the world. I have nobody to leave that I
      need worry about, or who would either take care of me or feel sorry for me
      if I needed care or sympathy, which I do not. So that is why I laugh, and
      that is why I come down and sit upon this bench, in the sunshine, and
      enjoy the posthumous joke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbins did not appear to see the humor of the situation quite as strongly
      as the Living Skeleton did. At different times after, when they met he had
      offered the Skeleton more money if he wanted it, so that he might prolong
      his life a little, but the Skeleton always refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of friendship sprang up between Robbins and the Living Skeleton, at
      least, as much of a friendship as can exist between the living and the
      dead, for Robbins was a muscular young fellow who did not need to live at
      the Riviera on account of his health, but merely because he detested an
      English winter. Besides this, it may be added, although it really is
      nobody&rsquo;s business, that a Nice Girl and her parents lived in this
      particular part of the South of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Robbins took a little excursion in a carriage to Toulon. He had
      invited the Nice Girl to go with him, but on that particular day she could
      not go. There was some big charity function on hand, and one necessary
      part of the affair was the wheedling of money out of people&rsquo;s
      pockets, so the Nice Girl had undertaken to do part of the wheedling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very good at it, and she rather prided herself upon it, but then
      she was a very nice girl, pretty as well, and so people found it difficult
      to refuse her. On the evening of the day there was to be a ball at the
      principal hotel of the place, also in connection with this very desirable
      charity. Robbins had reluctantly gone to Toulon alone, but you may depend
      upon it he was back in time for the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to the Nice Girl when he met her, &ldquo;what
      luck collecting, to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the greatest luck,&rdquo; she replied enthusiastically, &ldquo;and
      whom do you think I got the most money from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea&mdash;that old English
      Duke, he certainly has money enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not from him at all; the very last person you would expect it
      from&mdash;your friend, the Living Skeleton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Robbins, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I found him on the bench where he usually sits, in the avenue
      of the palms. I told him all about the charity and how useful it was, and
      how necessary, and how we all ought to give as much as we could towards
      it, and he smiled and smiled at me in that curious way of his. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
      he said in a whisper, &lsquo;I believe the charity should be supported by
      everyone; I will give you eighty francs.&rsquo; Now, wasn&rsquo;t that
      very generous of him? Eighty francs, that was ten times what the Duke
      gave, and as he handed me the money he looked up at me and said in that
      awful whisper of his: &lsquo;Count this over carefully when you get home
      and see if you can find out what else I have given you. There is more than
      eighty francs there.&rsquo; Then, after I got home, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the Nice Girl paused, when she looked at the face of Robbins, to
      whom she was talking. That face was ghastly pale and his eyes were staring
      at her but not seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty francs,&rdquo; he was whispering to himself, and he seemed
      to be making a mental calculation. Then noticing the Nice Girl&rsquo;s
      amazed look at him, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I took it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; gasped Robbins, and without a word he turned
      and fled, leaving the Nice Girl transfixed with astonishment and staring
      after him with a frown on her pretty brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean by such conduct?&rdquo; she asked herself. But
      Robbins disappeared from the gathering throng in the large room of the
      hotel, dashed down the steps, and hurried along the narrow pavements
      toward the &ldquo;Golden Dragon.&rdquo; The proprietor was standing in the
      hallway with his hands behind him, a usual attitude with the Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; gasped Robbins, &ldquo;is Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      and then he remembered he didn&rsquo;t know the name. &ldquo;Where is the
      Living Skeleton?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to his room,&rdquo; answered the Dragon, &ldquo;he went
      early to- night, he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the number of his room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 40,&rdquo; and the proprietor rang a loud, jangling bell,
      whereupon one of the chambermaids appeared. &ldquo;Show this gentleman to
      No. 40.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl preceded Robbins up the stairs. Once she looked over her
      shoulder, and said in a whisper, &ldquo;Is he worse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Robbins, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      what I have come to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At No. 40 the girl paused, and rapped lightly on the door panel. There was
      no response. She rapped again, this time louder. There was still no
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the door,&rdquo; said Robbins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid to,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he said if he were asleep the door would be locked, and if
      he were dead the door would be open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he say that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it several times, sir; about a week ago the last time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbins turned the handle of the door; it was not locked. A dim light was
      in the room, but a screen before the door hid it from sight. When he
      passed round the screen he saw, upon the square marble-topped arrangement
      at the head of the bed, a candle burning, and its light shone on the dead
      face of the Skeleton, which had a grim smile on its thin lips, while in
      its clenched hand was a letter addressed to the proprietor of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Living Skeleton had given more than the eighty francs to that
      deserving charity.

    <h2>
      HIGH STAKES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The snow was gently sifting down through the white glare of the electric
      light when Pony Rowell buttoned his overcoat around him and left the
      Metropolitan Hotel, which was his home. He was a young man, not more than
      thirty, and his face was a striking one. It was clean cut and clean
      shaven. It might have been the face of an actor or the face of a
      statesman. An actor&rsquo;s face has a certain mobility of expression
      resulting from the habit of assuming characters differing widely. Rowell&rsquo;s
      face, when you came to look at it closely, showed that it had been
      accustomed to repress expression rather than to show emotion of any kind.
      A casual look at Pony Rowell made you think his face would tell you
      something; a closer scrutiny showed you that it would tell you nothing.
      His eyes were of a piercing steely gray that seemed to read the thoughts
      of others, while they effectually concealed his own. Pony Rowell was known
      as a man who never went back on his word. He was a professional gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular evening he strolled up the avenue with the easy
      carriage of a man of infinite leisure. He hesitated for a moment at an
      illy-lighted passage-way in the middle of a large building on a side
      street, then went in and mounted a stair. He rapped lightly at a door. A
      slide was shoved back and a man inside peered out at him for a moment.
      Instantly the door was opened, for Pony&rsquo;s face was good for
      admittance at any of the gambling rooms in the city. There was still
      another guarded door to pass, for an honest gambling-house keeper can
      never tell what streak of sudden morality may strike the police, and it is
      well to have a few moments&rsquo; time in which to conceal the
      paraphernalia of the business. Of course, Mellish&rsquo;s gambling rooms
      were as well known to the police as to Pony Rowell, but unless some fuss
      was made by the public, Mellish knew he would be free from molestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish was a careful man, and a visitor had to be well vouched for,
      before he gained admission. There never was any trouble in Mellish&rsquo;s
      rooms. He was often known to advise a player to quit when he knew the
      young gambler could not afford to lose, and instances were cited where he
      had been the banker of some man in despair. Everybody liked Mellish, for
      his generosity was unbounded, and he told a good story well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the room that Pony Rowell had penetrated, a roulette table was at
      its whirling work and faro was going on in another spot. At small tables
      various visitors were enjoying the game of poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Pony,&rdquo; cried Bert Ragstock, &ldquo;are you going to
      give me my revenge to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always willing to give anyone his revenge.&rdquo;
      answered Pony imperturbably, lighting a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then; come and sit down here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to play just yet. I want to look on for a
      while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you ever so long already. Sit
      down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know by this time, Bert, that when I say a thing I
      mean it. I won&rsquo;t touch a card till the clock begins to strike 12.
      Then I&rsquo;m wid ye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, Pony, you ought to be above that sort of thing. That&rsquo;s
      superstition, Rowell. You&rsquo;re too cool a man to mind when you touch a
      card. Come on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. At midnight, I said to myself, and at
      midnight it shall be or not at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gamblers in the place nodded approval of this resolution. It was
      all right enough for Bert Ragstock to sneer at superstition, because he
      was not a real gambler. He merely came to Mellish&rsquo;s rooms in the
      evening because the Stock Exchange did not keep open all night. Strange to
      say Ragstock was a good business man as well as a cool gambler. He
      bemoaned the fate that made him so rich that gambling had not the
      exhilarating effect on him which it would have had if he had been playing
      in desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clock began to chime midnight Pony Rowell took up the pack and
      began to shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in to win. I&rsquo;m
      after big game to- night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo; cried Bert, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      stand by you as long as the spots stay on the cards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gray morning, when most of the others had left and even Mellish
      himself was yawning, they were still at it. The professional gambler had
      won a large sum of money; the largest sum he ever possessed. Yet there was
      no gleam of triumph in his keen eyes. Bert might have been winning for all
      the emotion his face showed. They were a well matched pair, and they
      enjoyed playing with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Pony at last, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you had
      enough? Luck&rsquo;s against you. I wouldn&rsquo;t run my head any longer
      against a brick wall, if I were you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Pony, how often have I told you there is no such thing as
      luck. But to tell the truth I&rsquo;m tired and I&rsquo;m going home. The
      revenge is postponed. When do I meet the enemy again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pony Rowell shuffled the cards idly for a few moments without replying or
      raising his eyes. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next time I play you, Bert, it will be for high stakes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, aren&rsquo;t you satisfied with the stakes we played
      for to- night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I want to play you for a stake that will make even your hair
      stand on end. Will you do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell just yet. I have a big scheme on hand. I am
      to see a man to-day about it. All I want to know is that you promise to
      play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pony, this is mysterious. I guess you&rsquo;re not afraid I will
      flunk out. I&rsquo;m ready to meet you on any terms and for any stake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said. I&rsquo;ll let you know some of the particulars as
      soon as I find out all I want myself. Good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night to you, rather,&rdquo; said Bert, as Mellish helped him
      on with his overcoat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won the pile: robbing a poor man
      of his hard- earned gains!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the poor man does not need the money as badly as I do. Besides,
      I&rsquo;m going to give you a chance to win it all back again and more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ragstock had left, Pony still sat by the table absent-mindedly
      shuffling the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said Mellish, laying his hand on his
      shoulder, &ldquo;I would put that pile in the bank and quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The faro bank?&rdquo; asked Pony, looking up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d quit the business altogether if I were you. I&rsquo;m
      going to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all know that. You&rsquo;ve been going to quit for the last
      twenty years. Well, I&rsquo;m going to quit, too, but not just yet. That&rsquo;s
      what they all say, of course, but I mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early and crisp winter air Pony Rowell walked to the Metropolitan
      Hotel and to bed. At 3 that afternoon the man he had an appointment with,
      called to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me about an Insurance policy,&rdquo; the visitor
      began. An agent is always ready to talk of business. &ldquo;Now, were you
      thinking of an endowment scheme or have you looked into our new bond
      system of insurance? The twenty-pay-life style of thing seems to be very
      popular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; said Pony. &ldquo;If I
      were to insure my life in your company and were to commit suicide would
      that invalidate the policy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after two years. After two years, in our company, the policy is
      incontestable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years? That won&rsquo;t do for me. Can&rsquo;t you make it one
      year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do,&rdquo; said the agent, lowering
      his voice, &ldquo;I can ante-date the policy, so that the two years will
      end just when you like, say a year from now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If you can legally fix it so that the two years come to
      an end about this date next year I will insure in your company for
      $100,000.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent opened his eyes when the amount was mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want endowments or bonds, but the cheapest form of
      life insurance you have, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight life is what you want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight life it is, then, and I will pay you for the two years or
      say, to make it sure, for two years and a half down, when you bring me the
      papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that with part of the money he had won, Pony Rowell insured
      his life for $100,000, and with another part he paid his board and lodging
      for a year ahead at the Metropolitan Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder he kept to speculate on.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the year that followed he steadily refused to play with Bert
      Ragstock, and once or twice they nearly had a quarrel about it&mdash;that
      is as near as Pony could come to having a row with anybody, for
      quarrelling was not in his line. If he had lived in a less civilized part
      of the community Pony might have shot, but as it was quarrels never came
      to anything, therefore he did not indulge in any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year from the date of our last game? What nonsense it is waiting
      all that time. You play with others, why not with me? Think of the chances
      we are losing,&rdquo; complained Bert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have a game then that will make up for all the waiting,&rdquo;
      answered Rowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the anniversary came and when the hour struck that ushered it in
      Pony Rowell and Bert Ragstock sat facing each other, prepared to resume
      business on the old stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Bert, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;it feels good to
      get opposite you once more. Pony, you&rsquo;re a crank. We might have had
      a hundred games like this during the past year, if there wasn&rsquo;t so
      much superstition about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite like this. This is to be the last game I play, win or
      lose. I tell you that now, so that there won&rsquo;t be any talk of
      revenge if I win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it! I&rsquo;ve heard talk like that before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ve warned you. Now I propose that this be a game
      of pure luck. We get a new pack of cards, shuffle them, cut, then you pull
      one card and I another. Ace high. The highest takes the pot. Best two out
      of three. Do you agree?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. How much is the pile to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re dreaming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder! You never <i>saw</i> $100,000.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get the money if I lose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Pony, that&rsquo;s coming it a little strong. One hundred
      thousand dollars! Heavens and earth! How many business men in this whole
      city would expect their bare word to be taken for $100,000?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a business man. I&rsquo;m a gambler.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true. Is the money in sight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you&rsquo;ll be paid. Your money is not in sight. I trust
      you. Can&rsquo;t you trust me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite the same thing, Pony. I&rsquo;ll trust you for
      three times the money you have in sight, but when you talk about $100,000
      you are talking of a lot of cash.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can convince Mellish here that you will get your money, will
      you play?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can convince me just as easily as you can Mellish. What&rsquo;s
      the use of dragging him in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could convince you in a minute, but you might still refuse to
      play. Now I&rsquo;m bound to play this game and I can&rsquo;t take any
      risks. If my word and Mellish&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t good enough for you,
      why, say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Bert. &ldquo;If you can convince Mellish
      that you will pay if you lose I&rsquo;ll play you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell and Mellish retired into an inner room and after a few minutes
      reappeared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish&rsquo;s face was red when he went in. He was now a trifle pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this, Bert,&rdquo; Mellish said, &ldquo;and I
      think this game had better stop right here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not convinced that I am sure of my money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for me. Get out your new pack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given your word, Mellish,&rdquo; said Pony, seeing the
      keeper of the house was about to speak. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such a sum two out of three is too sudden. Make it five out of
      nine,&rdquo; put in Bert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new pack of cards was brought and the wrappings torn off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shuffle first; I&rsquo;ll cut,&rdquo; said Rowell. His lips
      seemed parched and he moistened them now and then, which was unusual for
      so cool a gambler. Mellish fidgeted around with lowered brow. Bert
      shuffled the cards as nonchalantly as if he had merely a $5 bill on the
      result. When each had taken a card, Bert held an ace and Pony a king. Pony
      shuffled and the turn up was a spot in Pony&rsquo;s hand and queen in that
      of his opponent. Bert smiled and drops began to show on Pony&rsquo;s
      forehead in spite of his efforts at self-control. No word was spoken by
      either players or onlookers. After the next deal Pony again lost. His
      imperturbability seemed to be leaving him. He swept the cards from the
      table with an oath. &ldquo;Bring another pack,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bert smiled at him across the table. He thought, of course, that they were
      playing for even stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He retired to one of the inner
      rooms. The first deal with the new pack turned in Pony&rsquo;s favor and
      he seemed to feel that his luck had changed, but the next deal went
      against him and also the one following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your shuffle,&rdquo; said Rowell, pushing the cards
      towards his opponent. Bert did not touch the cards, but smiled across at
      the gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Why don&rsquo;t you shuffle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; said Bert, quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      won five.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell drew his hand across his perspiring brow and stared at the man
      across the table. Then he seemed to pull himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it.
      Excuse me. I guess I&rsquo;ll go now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit where you are and let us have a game for something more modest.
      I don&rsquo;t care about these splurges myself and I don&rsquo;t suppose
      you do&mdash; now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no. I told you this was my last game. As to the splurge, if
      I had the money I would willingly try it again. So long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mellish came in and saw that the game was over he asked where Pony
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew when he had enough, I guess,&rdquo; answered Bert. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      gone home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in here, Bert. I want to speak with you,&rdquo; said Mellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone Mellish turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Pony didn&rsquo;t tell you where the money is to come
      from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he told you. That was enough for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no reason why you should not know now. I
      promised silence till the game was finished. He&rsquo;s insured his life
      for $100,000 and is going to commit suicide so that you may be paid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Bert, aghast. &ldquo;Why did you let the game
      go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to stop it, but I had given my word and you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let us stand chattering here. He&rsquo;s at the
      Metropolitan, isn&rsquo;t he? Then come along. Hurry into your coat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish knew the number of Rowell&rsquo;s room and so no time was lost in
      the hotel office with inquiries. He tried the door, but, as he expected,
      it was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried a voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Mellish. I want to speak with you a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bert wants to say something. It&rsquo;s important. Let us in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you in. Go away and don&rsquo;t make a fuss. It
      will do no good. You can get in ten minutes from now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pony, you open that door at once, or I&rsquo;ll kick it
      in. You hear me? I want to see you a minute, and then you can do what you
      like,&rdquo; said Bert, in a voice that meant business.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Rowell opened the door and the two
      stepped in. Half of the carpet had been taken up and the bare floor was
      covered with old newspapers. A revolver lay on the table, also writing
      materials and a half-finished letter. Pony was in his shirt sleeves and he
      did not seem pleased at the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pony,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;I have confessed to
      Mellish and I&rsquo;ve come to confess to you. I want you to be easy with
      me and hush the thing up. I cheated. I stocked the cards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; said Rowell, looking him straight in
      the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that again,&rdquo; cried Ragstock, with his fingers
      twitching. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s mighty few men I would take that from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stocked the cards on me? I&rsquo;d like to see the man that
      could do it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were excited and didn&rsquo;t notice it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not only a liar, but you&rsquo;re an awkward liar. I
      have lost the money and I&rsquo;ll pay it. It would have been ready for
      you now, only I had a letter to write. Mellish has told you about the
      insurance policy and my will attached to it. Here they are. They&rsquo;re
      yours. I&rsquo;m no kicker. I know when a game&rsquo;s played fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bert took the policy and evidently intended to tear it in pieces, while
      Mellish, with a wink at him, edged around to get at the revolver. Ragstock&rsquo;s
      eye caught the name in big letters at the head of the policy, beautifully
      engraved. His eyes opened wide, then he sank into a chair and roared with
      laughter. Both the other men looked at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Mellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Why, this would have been a joke on Pony. It would do both
      of you some good to know a little about business as well as of gambling.
      The Hardfast Life Insurance Company went smash six months ago. It&rsquo;s
      the truth this time, Pony, even if I didn&rsquo;t stock the cards. Better
      make some inquiries in business circles before you try to collect any
      money from this institution. Now, Pony, order up the drinks, if anything
      can be had at this untimely hour. We are your guests so you are expected
      to be hospitable. I&rsquo;ve had all the excitement I want for one night.
      We&rsquo;ll call it square and begin over again.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      The splendid steamship Adamant, of the celebrated Cross Bow line, left New
      York on her February trip under favorable auspices. There had just been a
      storm on the ocean, so there was every chance that she would reach
      Liverpool before the next one was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Rice had a little social problem to solve at the outset, but he
      smoothed that out with the tact which is characteristic of him. Two
      Washington ladies&mdash;official ladies&mdash;were on board, and the
      captain, old British sea-dog that he was, always had trouble in the matter
      of precedence with Washington ladies. Capt. Rice never had any bother with
      the British aristocracy, because precedence is all set down in the bulky
      volume of &ldquo;Burke&rsquo;s Peerage,&rdquo; which the captain kept in
      his cabin, and so there was no difficulty. But a republican country is
      supposed not to meddle with precedence. It wouldn&rsquo;t, either, if it
      weren&rsquo;t for the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it happened that Mrs. Assistant-Attorney-to-the-Senate Brownrig came to
      the steward and said that, ranking all others on board, she must sit at
      the right hand of the captain. Afterwards Mrs. Second-Adjutant-to-
      the-War-Department Digby came to the same perplexed official and said she
      must sit at the captain&rsquo;s right hand because in Washington she took
      precedence over everyone else on board. The bewildered steward confided
      his woes to the captain, and the captain said he would attend to the
      matter. So he put Mrs. War-Department on his right hand and then walked
      down the deck with Mrs. Assistant-Attorney and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask a favor, Mrs. Brownrig. Unfortunately I am a little
      deaf in the right ear, caused, I presume, by listening so much with that
      ear to the fog horn year in and year out. Now, I always place the lady
      whose conversation I wish most to enjoy on my left hand at table. Would
      you oblige me by taking that seat this voyage? I have heard of you, you
      see, Mrs. Brownrig, although you have never crossed with me before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly, captain,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Brownrig; &ldquo;I
      feel especially complimented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I assure you, madam,&rdquo; said the polite captain, &ldquo;that
      I would not for the world miss a single word that,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was amicably arranged between the two ladies. All this has
      nothing whatever to do with the story. It is merely an incident given to
      show what a born diplomat Capt. Rice was and is to this day. I don&rsquo;t
      know any captain more popular with the ladies than he, and besides he is
      as good a sailor as crosses the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day the good ship ploughed her way toward the east, and the
      passengers were unanimous in saying that they never had a pleasanter
      voyage for that time of the year. It was so warm on deck that many steamer
      chairs were out, and below it was so mild that a person might think he was
      journeying in the tropics. Yet they had left New York in a snow storm with
      the thermometer away below zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; said young Spinner, who knew everything, &ldquo;such
      is the influence of the Gulf Stream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless when Capt. Rice came down to lunch the fourth day out his
      face was haggard and his look furtive and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, captain,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Assistant-Attorney, you look as if
      you hadn&rsquo;t slept a wink last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slept very well, thank you, madam.&rdquo; replied the captain.
      &ldquo;I always do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope your room was more comfortable than mine. It seemed to
      me too hot for anything. Didn&rsquo;t you find it so, Mrs. Digby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it very nice,&rdquo; replied the lady at the captain&rsquo;s
      right, who generally found it necessary to take an opposite view from the
      lady at the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;we have many delicate
      women and children on board and it is necessary to keep up the
      temperature. Still, perhaps the man who attends to the steam rather
      overdoes it. I will speak him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the captain pushed from him his untasted food and went up on the
      bridge, casting his eye aloft at the signal waving from the masthead,
      silently calling for help to all the empty horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in sight, Johnson?&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a speck, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain swept the circular line of sea and sky with his glasses, then
      laid them down with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to raise something this afternoon, sir,&rdquo; said
      Johnson; &ldquo;we are right in their track, sir. The Fulda ought to be
      somewhere about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too far north for the Fulda, I am afraid,&rdquo; answered
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, we should see the Vulcan before night, sir. She&rsquo;s
      had good weather from Queenstown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain moodily paced the bridge with his head down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have turned back to New York,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went down to his own room, avoiding the passengers as much as he
      could, and had the steward bring him some beef-tea. Even a captain cannot
      live on anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steamer off the port bow, sir,&rdquo; rang out the voice of the
      lookout at the prow. The man had sharp eyes, for a landsman could have
      seen nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run and tell the captain,&rdquo; cried Johnson to the sailor at his
      elbow, but as the sailor turned the captain&rsquo;s head appeared up the
      stairway. He seized the glass and looked long at a single point in the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the Vulcan,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn your wheel a few points to port and bear down on her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson gave the necessary order and the great ship veered around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Spinner, on deck. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
      steamer. I found her. She&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a rush to the side of the ship. &ldquo;A steamer in sight!&rdquo;
      was the cry, and all books and magazines at once lost interest. Even the
      placid, dignified Englishman who was so uncommunicative, rose from his
      chair and sent his servant for his binocular. Children were held up and
      told to be careful, while they tried to see the dim line of smoke so far
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk about lane routes at sea,&rdquo; cried young Spinner, the
      knowing. &ldquo;Bosh, I say. See! we&rsquo;re going directly for her.
      Think what it might be in a fog! Lane routes! Pure luck, I call it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we signal to her, Mr. Spinner?&rdquo; gently asked the young
      lady from Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; answered young Spinner. &ldquo;See there&rsquo;s
      our signal flying from the masthead now. That shows them what line we
      belong to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, how interesting,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;You
      have crossed many times, I suppose, Mr. Spinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know my way about,&rdquo; answered the modest Spinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain kept the glasses glued to his eyes. Suddenly he almost let
      them drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Johnson,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> flying a signal of distress, <i>too</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two steamers slowly approached each other and, when nearly alongside
      and about a mile apart, the bell of the Adamant rang to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; said young Spinner to the Boston girl,
      &ldquo;she is flying the same flag at her masthead that we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she belongs to the same line as this boat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cock-Sure Spinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look! look! look!&rdquo; cried the enthusiastic Indianapolis
      girl who was going to take music in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone looked aloft and saw running up to the masthead a long line of
      fluttering, many-colored flags. They remained in place for a few moments
      and then fluttered down again, only to give place to a different string.
      The same thing was going on on the other steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is too interesting for anything,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Assistant. &ldquo;I am just dying to know what it all means. I have read
      of it so often but never saw it before. I wonder when the captain will
      come down. What does it all mean?&rdquo; she asked the deck steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are signalling to each other, madam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know <i>that</i>. But what <i>are</i> they signalling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, madam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, see! see!&rdquo; cried the Indianapolis girl, clapping her
      hands with delight. &ldquo;The other steamer is turning round.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed so. The great ship was thrashing the water with her screw,
      and gradually the masts came in line and then her prow faced the east
      again. When this had been slowly accomplished the bell on the Adamant rang
      full speed ahead, and then the captain came slowly down the ladder that
      led from the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, captain, what does it all mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she going back, captain? Nothing wrong, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is it, captain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She belongs to our line, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is she going back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship,&rdquo; said the captain slowly, &ldquo;is the Vulcan, of
      the Black Bowling Line, that left Queenstown shortly after we left New
      York. She has met with an accident. Ran into some wreckage, it is thought,
      from the recent storm. Anyhow there is a hole in her, and whether she sees
      Queenstown or not will depend a great deal on what weather we have and
      whether her bulkheads hold out. We will stand by her till we reach
      Queenstown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there many on board, do you think, captain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are thirty-seven in the cabin and over 800 steerage
      passengers,&rdquo; answered the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take them on board, out of danger, captain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam, there is no need to do that. It would delay us, and time
      is everything in a case like this. Besides, they will have ample warning
      if she is going down and they will have time to get everybody in the
      boats. We will stand by them, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the poor creatures,&rdquo; cried the sympathetic Mrs.
      Second-Adjutant. &ldquo;Think of their awful position. May be engulfed at
      any moment. I suppose they are all on their knees in the cabin. How
      thankful they must have been to see the Adamant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On all sides there was the profoundest sympathy for the unfortunate
      passengers of the Vulcan. Cheeks paled at the very thought of the
      catastrophe that might take place at any moment within sight of the sister
      ship. It was a realistic object lesson on the ever-present dangers of the
      sea. While those on deck looked with new interest at the steamship
      plunging along within a mile of them, the captain slipped away to his
      room. As he sat there there was a tap at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; shouted the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silent Englishman slowly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, captain,&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Vulcan has had a hole stove in her and I signalled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know all that, of course, but what&rsquo;s wrong <i>with us</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With us?&rdquo; echoed the captain blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with the Adamant? What has been amiss for the last two or
      three days? I&rsquo;m not a talker, nor am I afraid any more than you are,
      but I want to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Please shut the door,
      Sir John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was a lively row on board the Vulcan. In the saloon Capt.
      Flint was standing at bay with his knuckles on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what the devil&rsquo;s the meaning of all this?&rdquo; cried
      Adam K. Vincent, member of Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of frightened women were standing around, many on the verge of
      hysterics. Children clung, with pale faces, to their mother&rsquo;s
      skirts, fearing they knew not what. Men were grouped with anxious faces,
      and the bluff old captain fronted them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meaning of all <i>what</i>, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well. What is the meaning of our turning-round?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, sir, that the Adamant has eighty-five saloon passengers
      and nearly 500 intermediate and steerage passengers who are in the most
      deadly danger. The cotton in the hold is on fire, and they have been
      fighting it night and day. A conflagration may break out at any moment. It
      means, then, sir, that the Vulcan is going to stand by the Adamant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wail of anguish burst from the frightened women at the awful fate that
      might be in store for so many human beings so near to them, and they clung
      closer to their children and thanked God that no such danger threatened
      them and those dear to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dammit, sir,&rdquo; cried the Congressman, &ldquo;do you mean
      to tell us that we have to go against our will&mdash;without even being
      consulted&mdash;back to Queenstown?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to tell you so, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by the gods, that&rsquo;s an outrage, and I won&rsquo;t stand
      it, sir. I must be in New York by the 27th. I won&rsquo;t stand it, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, sir, that anybody should be delayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delayed? Hang it all, why don&rsquo;t you take the people on board
      and take 'em to New York? I protest against this. I&rsquo;ll bring a
      lawsuit against the company, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vincent,&rdquo; said the captain sternly, &ldquo;permit me to
      remind you that <i>I</i> am captain of this ship. Good afternoon, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congressman departed from the saloon exceeding wroth, breathing dire
      threats of legal proceedings against the line and the captain personally,
      but most of the passengers agreed that it would be an inhuman thing to
      leave the Adamant alone in mid-ocean in such terrible straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they turn back, Captain Flint?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      General Weller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, madam, every moment is of value in such a case, and we are
      nearer Queenstown than New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the two steamships, side by side, worried their way toward the
      east, always within sight of each other by day, and with the rows of
      lights in each visible at night to the sympathetic souls on the other. The
      sweltering men poured water into the hold of the one and the pounding
      pumps poured water out of the hold of the other, and thus they reached
      Queenstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On board the tender that took the passengers ashore at Queenstown from
      both steamers two astonished women met each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! <i>Mrs.&mdash;General</i>&mdash;WELLER!!! You don&rsquo;t mean
      to say you were on board that unfortunate Vulcan!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake, Mrs. Assistant Brownrig! Is that really
      <i>you</i>? Will wonders never cease? Unfortunate, did you say? Mightily
      fortunate for you, I think. Why! weren&rsquo;t you just frightened to
      death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, but I had no idea anyone I knew was on board.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you were on board yourself. That would have been enough to
      have killed me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board myself? Why, what <i>do</i> you mean? I wasn&rsquo;t on
      board the Vulcan. Did you get any sleep at all after you knew you might go
      down at any moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sakes, Jane, what <i>are</i> you talking about? <i>Down</i> at
      any moment? It was you that might have gone down at any moment or, worse
      still, have been burnt to death if the fire had got ahead. You don&rsquo;t
      mean to say you didn&rsquo;t know the Adamant was on fire most of the way
      across?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mrs.&mdash;General&mdash;Weller!!</i> There&rsquo;s some <i>horrible</i>
      mistake. It was the Vulcan. Everything depended on her bulkheads, the
      captain said. There was a hole as big as a barn door in the Vulcan. The
      pumps were going night and day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. General looked at Mrs. Assistant as the light began to dawn on both
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t the engines, but the pumps,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t the steam, but the fire,&rdquo; screamed Mrs.
      Assistant. &ldquo;Oh, dear, how that captain lied, and I thought him such
      a nice man, too. Oh, I shall go into hysterics, I know I shall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rdquo; said the sensible Mrs.
      General, who was a strong-minded woman; &ldquo;besides, it is too late. We&rsquo;re
      all safe now. I think both captains were pretty sensible men. Evidently
      married, both of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was quite true.

    <h2>
      THE DEPARTURE OF CUB MCLEAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course no one will believe me when I say that Mellish was in every
      respect, except one, an exemplary citizen and a good-hearted man. He was
      generous to a fault and he gave many a young fellow a start in life where
      a little money or a few encouraging words were needed. He drank, of
      course, but he was a connoisseur in liquors, and a connoisseur never goes
      in for excess. Few could tell a humorous story as well as Mellish, and he
      seldom dealt in chestnuts. No man can be wholly bad who never inflicts an
      old story on his friends, locating it on some acquaintance of his, and
      alleging that it occurred the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I wished to write a heart-rending article on the evils of gambling,
      Mellish would be the man I would go to for my facts and for the moral of
      the tale. He spent his life persuading people not to gamble. He never
      gambled himself, he said. But if no attention was paid to his advice, why
      then he furnished gamblers with the most secluded and luxurious gambling
      rooms in the city. It was supposed that Mellish stood in with the police,
      which was, of course, a libel. The idea of the guardians of the city
      standing in with a gambler or a gambling house! The statement was absurd
      on the face of it. If you asked any policeman in the city where Mellish&rsquo;s
      gambling rooms were, you would speedily learn that not one of them had
      ever even heard of the place. All this goes to show how scandalously
      people will talk, and if Mellish&rsquo;s rooms were free from raids, it
      was merely Mellish&rsquo;s good luck, that was all. Anyhow, in Mellish&rsquo;s
      rooms you could have a quiet, gentlemanly game for stakes about as high as
      you cared to go, and you were reasonably sure there would be no fuss and
      that your name would not appear in the papers next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night as Mellish cast his eye around his well-filled main room he
      noticed a stranger sitting at the roulette table. Mellish had a keen eye
      for strangers and in an unobtrusive way generally managed to find out
      something about them. A stranger in a gambling room brings in with him a
      certain sense of danger to the habitués.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that boy?&rdquo; whispered Mellish to his bartender,
      generally known as Sotty, an ex-prize fighter and a dangerous man to
      handle if it came to trouble. It rarely came to trouble there, but Sotty
      was, in a measure, the silent symbol of physical force, backing the
      well-known mild morality of Mellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; answered Sotty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did he come in with?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him come in. Hadn&rsquo;t noticed him till now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish looked at the boy for a few minutes. He had the fresh, healthy,
      smooth face of a lad from the country, and he seemed strangely out of
      place in the heated atmosphere of that room, under the glare of the gas.
      Mellish sighed as he looked at him, then he turned to Sotty and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just get him away quietly and bring him to the small poker room. I
      want to have a few words with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sotty, who had the utmost contempt for the humanitarian feelings of his
      boss, said nothing, but a look of disdain swept over his florid features
      as he went on his mission. If he had his way, he would not throw even a
      sprat out of the net. Many a time he had known Mellish to persuade a
      youngster with more money than brains to go home, giving orders at the
      double doors that he was not to be admitted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose with a look of something like consternation on his face
      and followed Sotty. The thing was done quietly, and all those around the
      tables were too much absorbed in the game to pay much attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my boy,&rdquo; said Mellish, when they were alone,
      &ldquo;who brought you to this place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said the lad, with an expression of resentment,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old enough to go where I like without being brought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said Mellish, diplomatically,
      knowing how much very young men dislike being accused of youth, &ldquo;but
      I like to know all visitors here. You couldn&rsquo;t get in unless you
      came with someone known at the door. Who vouched for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Mr. Mellish,&rdquo; said the youth angrily, &ldquo;what
      are you driving at? If your doorkeepers don&rsquo;t know their own
      business why don&rsquo;t you speak to them about it? Are you going to have
      me turned out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said Mellish, soothingly, putting his
      hand in a fatherly manner on the young fellow&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      mistake my meaning. The fact that you are here shows that you have a right
      to be here. We&rsquo;ll say no more about that. But you take my advice and
      quit the business here and now. I was a gambler before you were born,
      although I don&rsquo;t gamble any more. Take the advice of a man who
      knows. It doesn&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to have paid you reasonably well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t complain. It has its ups and downs like all
      businesses. Still, it doesn&rsquo;t pay me nearly as well as perhaps you
      think, and you can take my word that in the long run it won&rsquo;t pay
      you at all. How much money have you got?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to pay if I lose,&rdquo; said the boy impudently; then
      seeing the look of pain that passed over Mellish&rsquo;s face, he added
      more civilly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have three or four hundred dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take my advice and go home. You&rsquo;ll be just that much
      better off in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you play a square game here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we play a square game here,&rdquo; answered Mellish with
      indignation. &ldquo;Do you think I am a card-sharper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem so cock-sure I&rsquo;ll lose my money that I was just
      wondering. Now, I can afford to lose all the money I&rsquo;ve got and not
      feel it. Are you going to allow me to play, or are you going to chuck me
      out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can play if you want to. But don&rsquo;t come whining to me
      when you lose. I&rsquo;ve warned you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a whiner,&rdquo; said the young fellow; &ldquo;I take
      my medicine like a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Mellish with a sigh. He realized that
      this fellow, young as he looked, was probably deeper in vice than his
      appearance indicated and he knew the uselessness of counsel in such a
      case. They went into the main room together and the boy, abandoning
      roulette, began to play at one of the card tables for ever-increasing
      stakes. Mellish kept an eye on him for a time. The boy was having the luck
      of most beginners. He played a reckless game and won hand over fist. As
      one man had enough and rose from the table another eagerly took his place,
      but there was no break in the boy&rsquo;s winnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pony Rowell was always late in arriving at the gambling rooms. On this
      occasion he entered, irreproachably dressed, and with the quiet,
      gentlemanly demeanor habitual with him. The professional gambler was never
      known to lose his temper. When displeased he became quieter, if possible,
      than before. The only sign of inward anger was a mark like an old scar
      which extended from his right temple, beginning over the eye and
      disappearing in his closely-cropped hair behind the ear. This line became
      an angry red that stood out against the general pallor of his face when
      things were going in a way that did not please him. He spoke in a low tone
      to Mellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the excitement down at the other end of the room?
      Every one seems congregated there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Mellish, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a boy&mdash;a
      stranger&mdash;who is having the devil&rsquo;s own luck at the start. It
      will be the ruin of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he playing high?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High? I should say so. He&rsquo;s perfectly reckless. He&rsquo;ll
      be brought up with a sharp turn and will borrow money from me to get out
      of town. I&rsquo;ve seen a flutter like that before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Pony tranquilly, &ldquo;I must have a go
      at him. I like to tackle a youngster in the first flush of success,
      especially if he is plunging.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon have a chance,&rdquo; answered Mellish, &ldquo;for
      even Ragstock knows when he has enough. He will get up in a moment. I know
      the signs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the air of a gentleman of leisure, somewhat tired of the frivolities
      of this world, Rowell made his way slowly to the group. As he looked over
      their shoulders at the boy a curious glitter came into his piercing eyes,
      and his lips, usually so well under control, tightened. The red mark began
      to come out as his face paled. It was evident that he did not intend to
      speak and that he was about to move away again, but the magnetism of his
      keen glance seemed to disturb the player, who suddenly looked up over the
      head of his opponent and met the stern gaze of Rowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy did three things. He placed his cards face downward on the table,
      put his right hand over the pile of money, and moved his chair back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; cried Ragstock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth ignored the question, still keeping his eyes on Rowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you squeal?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I squeal,&rdquo; said Pony, whatever the question and answer might
      mean. Then Rowell cried, slightly raising his voice so that all might
      hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man is Cub McLean, the most notorious card-sharper, thief, and
      murderer in the west. He couldn&rsquo;t play straight if he tried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McLean laughed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if you want to see
      my trademark look at the side of Greggs&rsquo; face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man looked at Pony, learning for the first time that he had gone
      under a different name at some period of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the momentary distraction McLean swept the money off the table and
      put it in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cried Ragstock, seemingly not quite understanding
      the situation. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t won that yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again McLean laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been the same in ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up, scattering the crowd behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to the doors,&rdquo; cried Pony. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let this
      man out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McLean had his back to the wall. From under his coat he whipped two
      revolvers which he held out, one in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know me better than that, Greggs,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;do you want me to have another shot at you? I won&rsquo;t miss this
      time. Drop that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last command was given in a ringing voice that attracted every one&rsquo;s
      attention to Sotty. He had picked up a revolver from somewhere behind the
      bar and had come out with it in his hand. McLean&rsquo;s eye seemed to
      take in every motion in the room and he instantly covered the bartender
      with one of the pistols as he gave the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it,&rdquo; said Mellish. &ldquo;There must be no shooting. You
      may go quietly. No one will interfere with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your sweet life they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said McLean with a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; continued Mellish, &ldquo;the house will stand
      the loss. If I allow a swindler in my rooms it is but right that I alone
      should suffer. Now you put up your guns and walk out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Mellish,&rdquo; sneered McLean, &ldquo;you ought to be
      running a Sunday- school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the permission to depart McLean did not relax his
      precautions for a moment. His shoulders scraped their way along the wall
      as he gradually worked towards the door. He kept Pony covered with his
      left hand while the polished barrel of the revolver in his right seemed to
      have a roving commission all over the room, to the nervous dread of many
      respectable persons who cowered within range. When he reached the door he
      said to Pony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Greggs, but this is too good an
      opportunity to miss. I&rsquo;m going to kill you in your tracks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about your size,&rdquo; said Pony putting his hands
      behind him and standing in his place, while those near him edged away.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unarmed, so it is perfectly safe. You will insure your
      arrest so blaze away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dodge under the table, then, and I will spare you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pony invited him to take up his abode in tropical futurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cub laughed once more good naturedly, and lowered the muzzle of his
      revolver. As he shoved back his soft felt hat, Mellish, who stood nearest
      him, saw that the hair on his temples was grey. Lines of anxiety had come
      into his apparently youthful face as he had scraped his way along the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, all,&rdquo; he shouted back from the stairway.

    <h2>
      OLD NUMBER EIGHTY-SIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Saggart stood in a dark corner of the terminus, out of the rays of
      the glittering arc lamps, and watched engine Number Eighty-six. The
      engineer was oiling her, and the fireman, as he opened the furnace-door
      and shovelled in the coal, stood out like a red Rembrandt picture in the
      cab against the darkness beyond. As the engineer with his oil can went
      carefully around Number Eighty-six, John Saggart drew his sleeve across
      his eyes, and a gulp came up his throat. He knew every joint and bolt in
      that contrary old engine&mdash;the most cantankerous iron brute on the
      road&mdash;and yet, if rightly managed, one of the swiftest and most
      powerful machines the company had, notwithstanding the many improvements
      that had been put upon locomotives since old Eighty-six had left the
      foundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saggart, as he stood there, thought of the seven years he had spent on the
      foot-board of old Eighty-six, and of the many tricks she had played him
      during that period. If, as the poet says, the very chains and the prisoner
      become friends through long association, it may be imagined how much of a
      man&rsquo;s affection goes out to a machine that he thoroughly understands
      and likes&mdash;a machine that is his daily companion for years, in danger
      and out of it. Number Eighty-six and John had been in many a close pinch
      together, and at this moment the man seemed to have forgotten that often
      the pinch was caused by the pure cussedness of Eighty-six herself, and he
      remembered only that she had bravely done her part several times when the
      situation was exceedingly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry &ldquo;All aboard&rdquo; rang out and was echoed down from the
      high-arched roof of the great terminus, and John with a sigh turned from
      his contemplation of the engine, and went to take his seat in the car. It
      was a long train with many sleeping-cars at the end of it. The engineer
      had put away his oil-can, and had taken his place on the engine, standing
      ready to begin the long journey at the moment the signal was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Saggart climbed into the smoking-carriage at the front part of the
      train. He found a place in one of the forward seats, and sank down into it
      with a vague feeling of uneasiness at being inside the coach instead of on
      the engine. He gazed out of the window and saw the glittering electric
      lights slide slowly behind, then, more quickly, the red, green, and white
      lights of the signal lamps, and finally there flickered swiftly past the
      brilliant constellation of city windows, showing that the town had not yet
      gone to bed. At last the flying train plunged into the country, and
      Saggart pressed his face against the cold glass of the window, unable to
      shake off his feeling of responsibility, although he knew there was
      another man at the throttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aroused from his reverie by a touch on the shoulder, and a curt
      request, &ldquo;Tickets, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out of his pocket a pass, and turned to hand it to the conductor
      who stood there with a glittering, plated, and crystal lantern on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, John, is this you?&rdquo; cried the conductor, as soon as he
      saw the face. &ldquo;Hang it, man, you didn&rsquo;t need a pass in
      travelling with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave it to me to take me home,&rdquo; said Saggart, a touch of
      sadness in his voice, &ldquo;and I may as well use it as not. I don&rsquo;t
      want to get you into trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d risk the trouble,&rdquo; said the conductor, placing
      the lantern on the floor and taking his seat beside the engineer. &ldquo;I
      heard about your worry to-day. It&rsquo;s too bad. If a man had got drunk
      at his post, as you and I have known &lsquo;em to do, it wouldn&rsquo;t
      have seemed so hard; but at its worst your case was only an error of
      judgment, and then nothing really happened. Old Eighty-six seems to have
      the habit of pulling herself through. I suppose you and she have been in
      worse fixes than that, with not a word said about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been in many a tight
      place together, but we won&rsquo;t be any more. It&rsquo;s rough, as you
      say. I&rsquo;ve been fifteen years with the company, and seven on old
      Eighty-six, and at first it comes mighty hard. But I suppose I&rsquo;ll
      get used to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, John,&rdquo; said the conductor, lowering his voice to a
      confidential tone, &ldquo;the president of the road is with us to-night;
      his private car is the last but one on the train. How would it do to speak
      to him? If you are afraid to tackle him, I&rsquo;ll put in a word for you
      in a minute, and tell him your side of the story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Saggart shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t
      overrule what one of his subordinates had done, unless there was serious
      injustice in the case. It&rsquo;s the new manager, you know. There&rsquo;s
      always trouble with a new manager. He sweeps clean. And I suppose that he
      thinks by &lsquo;bouncing&rsquo; one of the oldest engineers on the road,
      he will scare the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think much of him between ourselves,&rdquo;
      said the conductor. &ldquo;What do you think he has done to-night? He&rsquo;s
      put a new man on Eighty-six. A man from one of the branch lines who doesn&rsquo;t
      know the road. I doubt if he&rsquo;s ever been over the main line before.
      Now, it&rsquo;s an anxious enough time for me anyhow with a heavy train to
      take through, with the thermometer at zero, and the rails like glass, and
      I like to have a man in front that I can depend on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough not to know the road,&rdquo; said John
      gloomily, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s worse not to know old Eighty-six. She&rsquo;s
      a brute if she takes a notion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there is another engine that could draw this
      train and keep her time,&rdquo; said the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! She&rsquo;ll do her work all right if you&rsquo;ll only humor
      her,&rdquo; admitted Saggart, who could not conceal his love for the
      engine even while he blamed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the conductor, rising and picking up his lantern,
      &ldquo;the man in front may be all right, but I would feel safer if you
      were further ahead than the smoker. I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t offer
      you a berth to-night, John, but we&rsquo;re full clear through to the rear
      lights. There isn&rsquo;t even a vacant upper on the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Saggart. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep, anyhow. I&rsquo;d rather sit here and look out of the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; said the conductor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop in
      and see you as the night passes on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saggart lit his pipe and gazed out into darkness. He knew every inch of
      the road&mdash;all the up grades and the down grades and the levels. He
      knew it even better in the murkiest night than in the clearest day. Now
      and then the black bulk of a barn or a clump of trees showed for one
      moment against the sky, and Saggart would say to himself, &ldquo;Now he
      should shut off an inch of steam,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Now he should throw
      her wide open.&rdquo; The train made few stops, but he saw that they were
      losing time. Eighty-six was sulking, very likely. Thinking of the engine
      turned his mind to his own fate. No man was of very much use in the world,
      after all, for the moment he steps down another is ready to stand in his
      place. The wise men in the city who had listened to his defence knew so
      well that an engine was merely a combination of iron and steel and brass,
      and that a given number of pounds of steam would get it over a given
      number of miles in a given number of hours, and they had smiled
      incredulously when he told them that an engine had her tantrums, and
      informed them that sometimes she had to be coddled up like any other
      female. Even when a man did his best there were occasions when nothing he
      could do would mollify her, and then there was sure to be trouble,
      although, he added, in his desire to be fair, she was always sorry for it
      afterward. Which remark, to his confusion, had turned the smile into a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered what Eighty-six thought of the new man. Not much, evidently,
      for she was losing time, which she had no business to do on that section
      of the road. Still it might be the fault of the new man not knowing when
      to push her for all she was worth and when to ease up. All these things go
      to the making of time. But it was more than probable that old Eighty-six,
      like Gilpin&rsquo;s horse, was wondering more and more what thing upon her
      back had got. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have trouble,&rdquo; muttered John to
      himself, &ldquo;when she finds out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor came in again and sat down beside the engineer. He said
      nothing, but sat there sorting his tickets, while Saggart gazed out of the
      window. Suddenly the engineer sprang to his feet with his eyes wide open.
      The train was swaying from side to side and going at great speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor looked up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Eighty-six,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is evidently going to make
      up for lost time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She should be slowing down for crossing the G. &amp; M. line,&rdquo;
      replied the engineer. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he cried a moment after,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve gone across the G. &amp; M. track on the keen jump.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor sprang to his feet. He knew the seriousness of such a thing.
      Even the fastest expresses must stop dead before crossing on the level the
      line of another railway. It is the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that fool in front know enough to stop at a crossing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo; said Saggart. &ldquo;He knows all
      right. Even the train boys know that. Old Eighty-six has taken the bit
      between her teeth. He can&rsquo;t stop her. Where do you pass No. 6
      to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pointsville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only six miles ahead,&rdquo; said the engineer;
      &ldquo;and in five minutes at this rate we will be running on her time and
      on her rails. She&rsquo;s always late, and won&rsquo;t be on the side
      track. I must get to Eighty-six.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saggart quickly made his way through the baggage-coach, climbed on the
      express car, and jumped on the coal of the tender. He cast his eye up the
      track and saw glimmering in the distance, like a faint wavering star, the
      headlight of No. 6. Looking down into the cab he realized the situation in
      a glance. The engineer, with fear in his face and beads of perspiration on
      his brow, was throwing his whole weight on the lever, the fireman helping
      him. Saggart leaped down to the floor of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside,&rdquo; he shouted; and there was such a ring of
      confident command in his voice that both men instantly obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saggart grasped the lever, and instead of trying to shut off steam flung
      it wide open. Number Eighty-six gave a quiver and a jump forward. &ldquo;You
      old fiend!&rdquo; muttered John between his teeth. Then he pushed the
      lever home, and it slid into place as if there had never been any
      impediment. The steam was shut off, but the lights of Pointsville flashed
      past them with the empty side-track on the left, and they were now flying
      along the single line of rails with the headlight of No. 6 growing
      brighter and brighter in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverse her, reverse her!&rdquo; cried the other engineer, with
      fear in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverse nothing,&rdquo; said Saggart. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll slide ten
      miles if you do. Jump, if you&rsquo;re afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man from the branch line promptly jumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save yourself,&rdquo; said Saggart to the stoker; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      bound to be a smash.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick by you, Mr. Saggart,&rdquo; said the fireman, who
      knew him. But his hand trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air-brake was grinding the long train and sending a shiver of fear
      through every timber, but the rails were slippery with frost, and the
      speed of the train seemed as great as ever. At the right moment Saggart
      reversed the engine, and the sparks flew up from her great drivers like
      catharine wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brace yourself,&rdquo; cried Saggart. &ldquo;No. 6 is backing up,
      thank God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next instant the crash came. Two headlights and two cow-catchers went to
      flinders, and the two trains stood there with horns locked, but no great
      damage done, except a shaking up for a lot of panic-stricken passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burly engineer of No. 6 jumped down and came forward, his mouth full
      of oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the h&mdash;l do you mean by running in on our time like this?
      Hello, is that you, Saggart? I thought there was a new man on to-night. I
      didn&rsquo;t expect this from <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Billy. It wasn&rsquo;t the new man&rsquo;s
      fault. He&rsquo;s back in the ditch with a broken leg, I should say, from
      the way he jumped. Old Eighty-six is to blame. She got on the rampage.
      Took advantage of the greenhorn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor came running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Number Eighty-six got her nose broke, and
      served her right, that&rsquo;s all. Tell the passengers there&rsquo;s no
      danger, and get &lsquo;em on board. We&rsquo;re going to back up to
      Pointsville. Better send the brakesmen to pick up the other engineer. The
      ground&rsquo;s hard tonight, and he may be hurt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to talk to the president,&rdquo; said the
      conductor emphatically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a condition of mind to listen
      to reason, judging from the glimpse I got of his face at the door of his
      car a moment ago. Either he re-instates you or I go gathering tickets on a
      street-car. This kind of thing is too exciting for my nerves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor&rsquo;s interview with the president of the road was
      apparently satisfactory, for old Number Eighty-six is trying to lead a
      better life under the guidance of John Saggart.

    <h2>
      PLAYING WITH MARKED CARDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bothered about that young fellow,&rdquo; said Mellish
      early one morning, to the professional gambler, Pony Rowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes here night after night, and he loses more than he can
      afford, I imagine. He has no income, so far as I can find out, except what
      he gets as salary, and it takes a mighty sight bigger salary than his to
      stand the strain he&rsquo;s putting on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is cashier in the Ninth National Bank. I don&rsquo;t know how
      much he gets, but it can&rsquo;t be enough to permit this sort of thing to
      go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pony Rowell shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would let it trouble me, if I were you,
      Mellish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless it does. I have advised him to quit, but it is no use.
      If I tell the doorkeeper not to let him in here, he will merely go
      somewhere else where they are not so particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess I don&rsquo;t quite understand you, Mellish, long as
      I have known you. In your place, now, I would either give up keeping a
      gambling saloon or I would give up the moral reformation line of business.
      I wouldn&rsquo;t try to ride two horses of such different tempers at the
      same time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never tried to reform you, Pony,&rdquo; said Mellish,
      with reproach in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I will give you credit for that much sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right with old stagers like you and me, Pony, but
      with a boy just beginning life, it is different. Now it struck me that you
      might be able to help me in this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought that was what you were leading up to,&rdquo; said
      Rowell, thrusting his hands deep in his trousers&rsquo; pockets. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      no missionary, remember. What did you want me to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted you to give him a sharp lesson. Couldn&rsquo;t you mark a
      pack of cards and get him to play high? Then, when you have taken all his
      ready money and landed him in debt to you so that he can&rsquo;t move,
      give him back his cash if he promises not to gamble again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell looked across at the subject of their conversation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I would flatter him so much as to even stock the cards on him. I&rsquo;ll
      clean him out if you like. But it won&rsquo;t do any good, Mellish. Look
      at his eyes. The insanity of gambling is in them. I used to think if I had
      $100,000, I would quit. I&rsquo;m old enough now to know that I wouldn&rsquo;t.
      I&rsquo;d gamble if I had a million.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped after I was your age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Mellish, you are the virtuous exception that proves the
      rule. You quit gambling the way the old woman kept tavern,&rdquo; and
      Rowell cast a glance over the busy room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish smiled somewhat grimly, then he sighed. &ldquo;I wish I was out of
      it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But, anyhow, you think over what I&rsquo;ve
      been talking about, and if you can see your way to giving him a sharp
      lesson I wish you would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right I will, but merely to ease your tender conscience,
      Mellish. It&rsquo;s no use, I tell you. When the snake has bitten, the
      victim is doomed. Gambling isn&rsquo;t a simple thing like the opium
      habit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><br />

    <p>
      Reggie Forme, the bank cashier, rose at last from the roulette table. He
      was flushed with success, for there was a considerable addition to the sum
      he had in his pockets when he sat down. He flattered himself that the
      result was due to the system he had elaborately studied out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing lures a man to destruction quicker than a system that can be
      mathematically demonstrated. It gives an air of business to gambling which
      is soothing to the conscience of a person brought up on statistics. The
      system generally works beautifully at first; then a cog slips and you are
      mangled in the machinery before you know where you are. As young Forme
      left the table he felt a hand on his shoulder, and looking around, met the
      impassive gaze of Pony Rowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young at the business, I see,&rdquo; remarked the
      professional quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo; asked the youngster, coloring, for
      one likes to be taken for a veteran, especially when one is an amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you fool away your time at roulette. That is a game for
      boys and women. Have you nerve enough to play a real game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call a real game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A game with cards in a private room for something bigger than half-
      dollar points.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on what capital you have. How much capital can you command?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier hesitated for a moment and his eyes fell from the steady light
      of Rowell&rsquo;s, which seemed to have an uncomfortable habit of looking
      into one&rsquo;s inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bring $1,000 here on Saturday night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. That will do as a starter. Is it an appointment then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you like. What time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I generally get here pretty late, but I can make an exception in
      your case. What do you say to 10 o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suit me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Don&rsquo;t fool away any of your money or nerve
      until I come. You will need all you have of both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The professional gambler and the amateur began their series of games a few
      minutes after ten in a little private room. The young man became more and
      more excited as the play went on. As for Pony, he was cool under any
      circumstances. Before an hour had passed the $1,000 was transferred from
      the possession of Forme into the pockets of the professional, and by
      midnight the younger man was another $1,000 in Rowell&rsquo;s debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my practice,&rdquo; said Rowell slowly, &ldquo;to
      play with a man unless he has the money in sight. I&rsquo;ve made an
      exception in your case, as luck was against you, but I think this has gone
      far enough. You may bring me the $1,000 you owe any day next week. No
      particular hurry, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow appeared to be dazed. He drew his hand across his brow
      and then said mechanically, as if he had just heard his opponent&rsquo;s
      remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry? All right. Next week. Certainly. I guess I&rsquo;ll go
      home now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forme went out, leaving Rowell idly shuffling the cards at the small
      table. The moment the young man had disappeared all Rowell&rsquo;s
      indolence vanished. He sprang up and put on his overcoat, then slipped out
      by the rear exit into the alley. He had made up his mind what Forme would
      do. Mentally he tracked him from the gambling rooms to the river and he
      even went so far as to believe he would take certain streets on his way
      thither. A gambler is nothing if not superstitious and so Rowell was not
      in the least surprised when he saw the young man emerge from the dark
      stairway, hesitate for a moment between the two directions open to him,
      and finally choose the one that the gambler expected him to take. The cold
      streets were deserted and so Rowell had more difficulty in following his
      late victim unperceived than he would have had earlier in the evening.
      Several times the older man thought the pursued had become aware of the
      pursuit, for Forme stopped and looked around him; once coming back and
      taking another street as if trying to double on the man who was following
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell began to realize the difficulty of the task he had set for himself,
      and as he had never had any faith in it anyhow, he began to feel
      uncomfortable and to curse the tender heart of Mellish. If the youngster
      got the idea into his head that he was followed he might succeed in giving
      his pursuer the slip, and then Rowell would find himself with the fool&rsquo;s
      death on his conscience, and what was to him infinitely worse, with a
      thousand dollars in his pocket that had been unfairly won. This thought
      made him curse Mellish afresh. It had been entirely against his own will
      that he had played with marked cards, but Mellish had insisted that they
      should take no chances, and the veteran knew too well the uncertainties of
      playing a fair game where a great object lesson was to be taught. It would
      make them look like two fools, Mellish had said, if Forme won the money.
      In answer to this Rowell had remarked that they were two fools anyhow, but
      he had finally succumbed to Mellish as the whole scheme was Mellish&rsquo;s.
      As Rowell thought bitterly of these things his attention was diverted from
      the very matter he had in hand. Few men can pursue a course of thought and
      a fellow-creature at the same time. He suddenly realized that young Forme
      had escaped him. Rowell stood alone in the dimly-lighted silent street and
      poured unuttered maledictions on his own stupidity. Suddenly a voice rang
      out from a dark doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you following me for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re there, are you?&rdquo; said Pony calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. Now what do you want of me? Aren&rsquo;t you
      satisfied with what you have done to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be fool-chasing at such an hour
      as this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you admit you have been following me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never denied it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me? Do I belong to myself or do you think I
      belong to you, because I owe you some money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, I am sure, to whom you belong,&rdquo; said Rowell
      with his slow drawl. &ldquo;I suspect, however, that the city police, who
      seem to be scarce at this hour, have the first claim upon you. What do I
      want of you? I want to ask you a question. Where did you get the money you
      played with to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume not. But as there are no witnesses to this interesting
      conversation I will venture an opinion that you robbed the bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took a step forward, but Pony stood his ground, using the
      interval to light another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will also venture an opinion, Mr. Rowell, and say that the money
      came as honestly into my pocket as it did into yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be saying much for it. I have the advantage of
      you, however, because the nine points are in my favor. I have possession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you following me for? To give me up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit the robbery, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be used against you. As I told you, there are no
      witnesses. It will pay you to be frank. Where did you get the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where many another man gets it. Out of the bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. Now, Forme, you are not such a fool as you look&mdash;or
      act. You know where all that sort of thing leads to. You haven&rsquo;t any
      chance. All the rules of the game are against you. You have no more show
      than you had against me to-night. Why not chuck it, before it is too late?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy for you to talk like that when you have my money in your
      pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that simply is another rule of the game. The money of a thief
      is bound to go into someone else&rsquo;s pocket. Whoever enjoys the cash
      ultimately, he never does. Now if you had the money in your pocket what
      would you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would go back to Mellish&rsquo;s and have another try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Rowell with, for the first time, some
      cordiality in his voice. He recognized a kindred spirit in this young man.
      &ldquo;Nevertheless it would be a foolish thing to do. You have two
      chances before you. You can become a sport as I am and spend your life in
      gambling rooms. Or you can become what is called a respectable business
      man. But you can&rsquo;t be both. In a very short time you will not have
      the choice. You will be found out and then you can only be what I am&mdash;
      probably not as successful as I have been. If you add bank robbery to your
      other accomplishments then you will go to prison or, what is perhaps
      worse, to Canada. Which career are you going to choose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to plain facts. What do you mean by all this talk? If I
      say I&rsquo;ll quit gambling do you mean that you will return to me the
      thousand dollars and call the other thousand square?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you give me your word of honor that you will quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t, what then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then on Monday I will hand over this money to the bank and advise
      them to look into your accounts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose my accounts prove to be all right, what then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;In that remote possibility I will
      give the thousand dollars to you and play you another game for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Which means that you cheated to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to put it that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I denounced you as a self-confessed cheat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t matter to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t take the trouble
      to deny it. Nobody would believe you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cool hand, Pony, I admire your cheek. Still, you&rsquo;ve
      got some silly elements in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean my trying to reform you? Don&rsquo;t make any mistake
      about that. It is Mellish&rsquo;s idea, not mine. I don&rsquo;t believe in
      you for a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed. He reflected for a few seconds, then said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      take your offer. You give me back the money and I will promise never to
      gamble again in any shape or form.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return the cash to the bank, if you took it from there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I will put it back the first thing on Monday morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here is your pile,&rdquo; said Rowell, handing him the roll of
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forme took it eagerly and, standing where the light struck down upon him,
      counted the bills, while Rowell looked on silently with a cynical smile on
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good
      fellow, Rowell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged for your good opinion. I hope you found the money
      correct?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Forme, flushing a little. &ldquo;I hope
      you did not mind my counting it. Merely a business habit, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stick to business habits, Mr. Forme. Good night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowell walked briskly back to Mellish&rsquo;s. Forme walked toward the
      railway station and found that there was a train for Chicago at 4 in the
      morning. He had one clear day and part of another before he was missed,
      and as it turned out all trace of him was lost in the big city. The bank
      found about $6,000 missing. Two years after, news came that Forme had been
      shot dead in a gambling hall in Southern Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are two first-class fools,&rdquo; said Rowell to Mellish,
      &ldquo;and I for one don&rsquo;t feel proud of the episode, so we&rsquo;ll
      say nothing more about it. The gambling mania was in his blood. Gambling
      is not a vice; it is a disease, latent in all of us.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE BRUISER&rsquo;S COURTSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Northern Bruiser sat in the chair in his corner and was being
      fanned he resolved to finish the fight at the next round. The superior
      skill of his opponent was telling upon him, and although the Bruiser was a
      young man of immense strength, yet, up to that time, the alertness and
      dexterity of the Yorkshire Chicken had baffled him, and prevented him from
      landing one of his tremendous shoulder thrusts. But even though skill had
      checkmated strength up to this point, the Chicken had not entirely
      succeeded in defending himself, and was in a condition described by the
      yelling crowd as &ldquo;groggy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When time was called the Bruiser was speedily on his feet. His face did
      not present the repulsive appearance so visible on the countenance of his
      opponent, but the Bruiser had experience enough to know that the body
      blows received in this fight had had their effect on his wind and staying
      powers; and that although the Chicken presented an appalling appearance
      with his swollen lips and cheeks, and his eyes nearly closed, yet he was
      in better trim for continuing the battle than the Bruiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chicken came up to the mark less promptly than his big antagonist, but
      whether it was from weakness or lack of sight, he seemed uncertain in his
      movements, and the hearts of his backers sank as they saw him stagger
      rather than walk to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Chicken, as it were, fully waked up to the situation, the
      Bruiser lunged forward and planted a blow on his temple that would have
      broken the guard of a man who was in better condition than the Chicken.
      The Yorkshireman fell like a log, and lay where he fell. Then the Bruiser
      got a lesson which terrified him. A sickly ashen hue came over the purple
      face of the man on the ground. The Bruiser had expected some defence, and
      the terrible blow had been even more powerful than he intended. A
      shivering whisper went round the crowd, &ldquo;He is killed,&rdquo; and
      instantly the silenced mob quietly scattered. It was every man for himself
      before the authorities took a hand in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bruiser stood there swaying from side to side, his gaze fixed upon the
      prostrate man. He saw himself indicted and hanged for murder, and he swore
      that if the Chicken recovered he would never again enter the ring. This
      was a phase of prize-fighting that he had never before had experience of.
      On different occasions he had, it is true, knocked out his various
      opponents, and once or twice he had been knocked out himself; but the
      Chicken had fought so pluckily up to the last round that the Bruiser had
      put forth more of his tremendous strength than he had bargained for, and
      now the man&rsquo;s life hung on a thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unconscious pugilist was carried to an adjoining room. Two physicians
      were in attendance upon him, and at first the reports were most gloomy,
      but towards daylight the Bruiser learned with relief that the chances were
      in favor of his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bruiser had been urged to fly, but he was a man of strong common
      sense, and he thoroughly understood the futility of flight. His face and
      his form were too well known all around the country. It would have been
      impossible for him to escape, even if he had tried to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Yorkshire Chicken recovered, the Bruiser&rsquo;s friends laughed
      at his resolve to quit the ring, but they could not shake it. The money he
      had won in his last fight, together with what he had accumulated before&mdash;for
      he was a frugal man&mdash;was enough to keep him for the rest of his days,
      and he resolved to return to the Border town where he was born, and where
      doubtless his fame had preceded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He buckled his guineas in a belt around him, and with a stout stick in his
      hand he left London for the North. He was a strong and healthy young man,
      and had not given way to dissipation, as so many prizefighters had done
      before, and will again. He had a horror of a cramped and confined, seat in
      a stage coach. He loved the free air of the heights and the quiet
      stillness of the valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the days of highwaymen, and travelling by coach was not
      considered any too safe. The Bruiser was afraid of no man that lived, if
      he met him in the open with a stick in his hand, or with nature&rsquo;s
      weapons, but he feared the muzzle of a pistol held at his head in the dark
      by a man with a mask over his face. So he buckled his belt around him with
      all his worldly gear in gold, took his own almost forgotten name, Abel
      Trenchon, set his back to the sun and his face to the north wind, and
      journeyed on foot along the king&rsquo;s highway. He stopped at night in
      the wayside inns, taking up his quarters before the sun had set, and
      leaving them when it was broad daylight in the morning. He disputed his
      reckonings like a man who must needs count the pennies, and no one
      suspected the sturdy wayfarer of carrying a fortune around his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his face turned toward the North his thought went to the Border town
      where he had spent his childhood. His father and mother were dead, and he
      doubted now if anyone there remembered him, or would have a welcome for
      him. Nevertheless no other spot on earth was so dear to him, and it had
      always been his intention, when he settled down and took a wife, to retire
      to the quiet little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather, at least, gave him a surly welcome. On the last day&rsquo;s
      tramp the wind howled and the rain beat in gusts against him, but he was a
      man who cared little for the tempest, and he bent his body to the blast,
      trudging sturdily on. It was evening when he began to recognize familiar
      objects by the wayside, and he was surprised to see how little change
      there had been in all the years he was away. He stopped at an inn for
      supper, and, having refreshed himself, resolved to break the rule he had
      made for himself throughout the journey. He would push on through the
      night, and sleep in his native village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm became more pitiless as he proceeded, and he found himself
      sympathizing with those poor creatures who were compelled to be out in it,
      but he never gave a thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly midnight when he saw the square church tower standing
      blackly out against the dark sky; and when he began to descend the valley,
      on the other side of which the town stood, a thrill of fear came over him,
      as he remembered what he had so long forgotten&mdash;that the valley was
      haunted, and was a particularly dangerous place about the hour of
      midnight. To divert his thoughts he then began to wonder who the woman was
      he would marry. She was doubtless now sleeping calmly in the village on
      the hill, quite unconscious of the approach of her lover and her husband.
      He could not conceal from himself the fact that he would be reckoned a
      good match when his wealth was known, for, excepting the Squire, he would
      probably be the richest man in the place. However, he resolved to be
      silent about his riches, so that the girl he married would little dream of
      the good fortune that awaited her. He laughed aloud as he thought of the
      pleasure he would have in telling his wife of her luck, but the laugh died
      on his lips as he saw, or thought he saw, something moving stealthily
      along the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now in the depth of the valley in a most lonesome and eerie spot.
      The huge trees on each side formed an arch over the roadway and partially
      sheltered it from the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in his tracks, grasped his stick with firmer hold, and shouted
      valiantly, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, but in the silence which followed he thought he heard
      a woman&rsquo;s sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out into the road,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or I shall fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His own fear of pistols was so great that he expected everyone else to be
      terrorized by the threat of using them; and yet he had never possessed nor
      carried a pistol in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;please don&rsquo;t fire,&rdquo; cried a trembling
      voice, from out the darkness. &ldquo;I will do as you tell me.&rdquo; And
      so saying the figure moved out upon the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trenchon peered at her through the darkness, but whether she was old or
      young he could not tell. Her voice seemed to indicate that she was young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, lass,&rdquo; said Trenchon, kindly, &ldquo;what dost thou here
      at such an hour and in such a night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, weeping; &ldquo;my father turned me out, as
      he has often done before, but to-night is a bitter night, and I had
      nowhere to go, so I came here to be sheltered from the rain. He will be
      asleep ere long, and he sleeps soundly. I may perhaps steal in by a
      window, although sometimes he fastens them down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth!&rdquo; cried Trenchon, angrily. &ldquo;Who is
      thy brute of a father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated, and then spoke as if to excuse him, but again Trenchon
      demanded his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the blacksmith of the village, and Cameron is his name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him,&rdquo; said Trenchon. &ldquo;Is thy mother, then,
      dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the girl, weeping afresh. &ldquo;She has been
      dead these five years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew her when I was a boy,&rdquo; said Trenchon. &ldquo;Thy
      father also, and many a grudge I owe him, although I had forgotten about
      them. Still, I doubt not but as a boy I was as much in fault as he,
      although he was harsh to all of us, and now it seems he is harsh to thee.
      My name is Trenchon. I doubt if any in the village now remember me,
      although, perhaps, they may have heard of me from London,&rdquo; he said,
      with some pride, and a hope that the girl would confirm his thoughts. But
      she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard thy name,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trenchon sighed. This, then, was fame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that matters not; they shall hear
      more of me later. I will go with thee to thy father&rsquo;s house and
      demand for thee admittance and decent usage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl shrank back. &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;that
      will never do. My father is a hard man to cross. There are none in the
      village who dare contend with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it may be,&rdquo; said Trenchon, with easy confidence.
      &ldquo;I, for one, fear him not. Come, lass, with me, and see if I cannot,
      after all these years, pick out thy father&rsquo;s dwelling. Come, I say,
      thou must not longer tarry here; the rain is coming on afresh, and these
      trees, thick as they are, form scant protection. It is outrageous that
      thou should wander in this storm, while thy brutal father lies in shelter.
      Nay, do not fear harm for either thee or me; and as for him, he shall not
      suffer if thou but wish it so.&rdquo; And, drawing the girl&rsquo;s hand
      through his arm, he took her reluctantly with him, and without direction
      from her soon stood before the blacksmith&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, triumphantly, &ldquo;I knew the place, and
      yet I have not seen the town for years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trenchon rapped soundly on the oaken door with his heavy stick, and the
      blows re-echoed through the silent house. The girl shrank timidly behind
      him, and would have fled, but that he held her firmly by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;believe me there is naught to
      fear. I will see that thou art not ill-used.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the window above was thrown up, and a string of fearful oaths
      greeted the two, whereat the girl once more tried to release her
      imprisoned wrist, but Trenchon held it lightly, though with a grip like
      steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout old man thrust his head through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s blight on thee!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;thou pair of
      fools who wish to wed so much that ye venture out in such a night as this.
      Well, have your way, and let me have my rest. In the name of the law of
      Scotland I pronounce ye man and wife. There, that will bind two fools
      together as strongly as if the Archbishop spoke the words. Place thou the
      money on the steps. I warrant none will venture to touch it when it
      belongs to me.&rdquo; And with that he closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he raving mad or drunk?&rdquo; cried Trenchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave a wailing cry. &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he
      is neither. He is so used to marrying folk who come from England across
      the Border that he thinks not it his daughter who came with thee, but two
      who wished to wed. They come at all hours of the night and day, and he has
      married us. I am thy wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The astonished man dropped her wrist, and she put her hands before her
      eyes and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; cried Trenchon. &ldquo;We two married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked with interest at the girl, but in the darkness could see nothing
      of her. The unheeded rain pelted on them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;hast thou some
      other lover, since you weep?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;comes near
      us. They fear my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if this be true, why dost thou weep? I am not considered so
      bad a fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I weep not for myself, but for thee, who through the kindness of
      thy heart hast been led into this trap. Believe me, it was not my
      intention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from thy voice, my girl, and if thou favorest thy mother,
      as I think, whom I remember well, this is a trap that I shall make little
      effort to get my foot out of. But thou art dripping, and I stand
      chattering here. Once more I will arouse my father-in-law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he stoutly rapped again with his stick upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the window was pushed up, and again the angry head appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get you gone!&rdquo; cried the maddened blacksmith, but before he
      could say anything further Trenchon cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thy daughter here who waits. Open the door, thou limb of
      hell, or I will burst it in and cast thee out as thou hast done thy
      daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith, who had never in his life been spoken to in tones or words
      like these, was so amazed that he could neither speak nor act, but one
      stout kick against the door so shook the fabric that he speedily saw
      another such would break into his domicile; so, leaving the window open
      that his curses might the better reach them, the blacksmith came down and
      threw the barrier from the door, flinging it open and standing on the
      threshold so as to bar all ingress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the way,&rdquo; cried Trenchon, roughly placing his hand on
      the other&rsquo;s breast with apparent lightness, but with a push that
      sent him staggering into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man pulled the girl in after him and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest the way,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Strike thou a
      light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling girl lit a candle, and as it shone upon her face Trenchon
      gave a deep sigh of happiness and relief. No girl in the village could be
      more fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith stood, his fingers clenched with rage; but he looked with
      hesitation and respect upon the burly form of the prizefighter. Yet the
      old man did not flinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw aside thy stick,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or wait until I can
      get me another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trenchon flung his stick into the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; cried the girl, clasping her hands. &ldquo;You must
      not fight.&rdquo; But she appealed to her husband and not to her father,
      which caused a glow of satisfaction to rise from the heart of the young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee out of this house,&rdquo; cried her father, fiercely,
      turning upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not thus to my wife,&rdquo; said Trenchon, advancing upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy wife?&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; repeated the young man with emphasis. &ldquo;They
      tell me, blacksmith, that thou art strong. That thou art brutal I know,
      but thy strength I doubt. Come to me and test it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sprang upon him, and the Bruiser caught him by the elbows and
      held him helpless as a child. He pressed him up against the wall, pushed
      his wrists together, and clasped them both in his one gigantic hand. Then,
      placing the other on the blacksmith&rsquo;s shoulder, he put his weight
      upon him, and the blacksmith, cursing but helpless, sank upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, thou hardened sinner,&rdquo; cried the Bruiser, bending over
      him. &ldquo;Beg from thy daughter on thy knees for a night&rsquo;s shelter
      in this house. Beg, or I will thrust thy craven face against the floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl clung to her newly-found husband, and entreated him not to hurt
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not hurt him if he do but speak. If he has naught but
      curses on his lips, why then those lips must kiss the flags that are
      beneath him. Speak out, blacksmith: what hast thou to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg for shelter,&rdquo; said the conquered man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the Bruiser released him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee to bed,&rdquo; he said, and the old man slunk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said Abel Trenchon, opening his arms, &ldquo;I have
      come all the way from London for thee. I knew not then what drew me north,
      but now I know that One wiser than me led my steps hither. As far as
      erring man may promise I do promise thee that thou shalt ne&rsquo;er
      regret being cast out this night into the storm.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE RAID ON MELLISH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some newspapers differ from others. One peculiarity about the Argus was
      the frequency with which it changed its men. Managing editors came who
      were going to revolutionize the world and incidentally the Argus, but they
      were in the habit of disappearing to give place to others who also
      disappeared. Newspaper men in that part of the country never considered
      themselves full-fledged unless they had had a turn at managing the Argus.
      If you asked who was at the head of the Argus the answer would very likely
      be: &ldquo;Well, So-and-so was managing it this morning. I don&rsquo;t
      know who is running it this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most weird period in the history of the Argus was when the
      owners imported a crank from Pittsburg and put him in as local editor,
      over the heads of the city staff. His name was McCrasky, christened Angus
      or Archie, I forget which, at this period of time. In fact, his Christian
      name was always a moot point; some of the reporters saying it was Angus
      and others Archie, no one having the courage to ask him. Anyhow, he signed
      himself A. McCrasky. He was a good man, which was rather an oddity on the
      staff, and puzzled the reporters not a little. Most of his predecessors
      had differed much from each other, but they were all alike in one thing,
      and that was profanity. They expressed disapproval in language that made
      the hardened printers&rsquo; towel in the composing room shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky&rsquo;s great point was that the local pages of the paper should
      have a strong moral influence on the community. He knocked the sporting
      editor speechless by telling him that they would have no more reports of
      prize-fights. Poor Murren went back to the local room, sat down at his
      table and buried his head in his hands. Every man on a local staff
      naturally thinks the paper is published mainly to give his department a
      show, and Murren considered a fight to a finish as being of more real
      importance to the world than a presidential election. The rest of the boys
      tried to cheer him up. &ldquo;A fine state of things,&rdquo; said Murren
      bitterly. &ldquo;Think of the scrap next week between the California
      Duffer and Pigeon Billy and no report of it in the Argus! Imagine the
      walk- over for the other papers. What in thunder does he think people want
      to read?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another surprise in store for the boys. McCrasky assembled
      them all in his room and held forth to them. He suddenly sprung a question
      on the criminal reporter&mdash;so suddenly that Thompson, taken unawares,
      almost spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know of any gambling houses in this city?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson caught his breath and glanced quickly at Murren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, but perhaps the
      religious editor does. Better ask him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The religious editor smiled and removed his corn-cob pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
      know it was against the law to keep a gambling house in this state? Yes,
      sir!&rdquo; Then he put his corn- cob pipe back in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky was pleased to see that his young men knew so little of the
      wickedness of a great city; nevertheless he was there to give them some
      information, so he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it is against the law; but many things that are against
      the law flourish in a city like this. Now I want you to find out before
      the week is past how many gambling houses there are and where they are
      located. When you are sure of your facts we will organize a raid and the
      news will very likely be exclusive, for it will be late at night and the
      other papers may not hear of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said the religious editor, with a twinkle in his
      eye, as he again removed his corn-cob, &ldquo;that&mdash;assuming such
      places to exist&mdash;you found some representatives of the other papers
      there? They are a bad lot, the fellows on the other papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are there,&rdquo; said the local editor, &ldquo;they will
      go to prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t mind that, if they can write something about it,&rdquo;
      said Murren gloomily. In his opinion the Argus was going to the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Thompson,&rdquo; said McCrasky, &ldquo;you as criminal
      reporter must know a lot of men who can give you particulars for a
      first-rate article on the evils of gambling. Get it ready for Saturday&rsquo;s
      paper&mdash;a column and a half, with scare heads. We must work up public
      opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys got back into the local room again, Murren sat with his head
      in his hands, while Thompson leaned back in his chair and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work up public opinion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mac had better work
      up his own knowledge of the city streets, and not put Bolder avenue in the
      East End, as he did this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The religious editor was helping himself to tobacco from Murren&rsquo;s
      drawer. &ldquo;Are you going to put Mellish on his guard?&rdquo; he asked
      Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just know what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; said
      Thompson; &ldquo;are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; replied the R. E. &ldquo;Beastly
      poor tobacco, this of yours, Murren. Why don&rsquo;t you buy cut plug?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not compelled to smoke it,&rdquo; said the sporting
      editor, without raising his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am when mine is out, and the other fellows keep their drawers
      locked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson dropped in on Mellish, the keeper of the swell gambling rooms, to
      consult with him on the article for Saturday&rsquo;s paper. Mellish took a
      great interest in it, and thought it would do good. He willingly gave
      Thompson several instances where the vice had led to ruin of promising
      young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All men gamble in some way or another,&rdquo; said Mellish
      meditatively. &ldquo;Some take it one way and some another. It is inherent
      in human nature, like original sin. The beginning of every business is a
      gamble. If I had $30,000 I would rather run my chance of doubling it at
      these tables here than I would, for instance, by starting a new newspaper
      or putting it on wheat or in railway stocks. Take a land boom, for
      instance, such as there was in California or at Winnipeg&mdash;the
      difference between putting your money in a thing like that or going in for
      legitimate gambling is that, in the one case, you are sure to lose your
      cash, while in the other you have a chance of winning some. I hold that
      all kinds of gambling are bad, unless a man can easily afford to lose what
      he stakes. The trouble is that gambling affects some people like liquor. I
      knew a man once who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but you can read the whole
      article if you turn up the back numbers of the Argus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson told Mellish about McCrasky. Mellish was much interested, and
      said he would like to meet the local editor. He thought the papers should
      take more interest in the suppression of gambling dens than they did, and
      for his part he said he would like to see them all stopped, his own
      included. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I could shut up my
      shop, but it would simply mean that someone else would open another, and I
      don&rsquo;t think any man ever ran such a place fairer than I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky called on the chief of police, and introduced himself as the
      local editor of the Argus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;has Gorman gone, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Gorman,&rdquo; said McCrasky; &ldquo;the
      man I succeeded was Finnigan. I believe he is in Cincinnati now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the chief learned the purport of the local editor&rsquo;s visit he
      became very official and somewhat taciturn. He presumed that there were
      gambling houses in the city. If there were, they were very quiet and no
      complaints ever reached his ears. There were many things, he said, that it
      was impossible to suppress, and the result of attempted suppression was to
      drive the evil deeper down. He seemed to be in favor rather of regulating,
      than of attempting the impossible; still, if McCrasky brought him
      undoubted evidence that a gambling house was in operation, he would
      consider it his duty to make a raid on it. He advised McCrasky to go very
      cautiously about it, as the gamblers had doubtless many friends who would
      give a tip and so frustrate a raid, perhaps letting somebody in for
      damages. McCrasky said he would be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance played into the hands of McCrasky and &ldquo;blew in&rdquo; on him
      a man who little recked what he was doing when he entered the local editor&rsquo;s
      room. Gus Hammerly, sport and man-about-town, dropped into the Argus
      office late one night to bring news of an &ldquo;event&rdquo; to the
      sporting editor. He knew his way about in the office, and, finding Murren
      was not in, he left the item on his table. Then he wandered into the local
      editor&rsquo;s room. The newspaper boys all liked Hammerly, and many a
      good item they got from him. They never gave him away, and he saw that
      they never got left, as the vernacular is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening. You&rsquo;re the new local editor, I take it. I&rsquo;ve
      just left a little item for Murren, I suppose he&rsquo;s not in from the
      wrestle yet. My name&rsquo;s Hammerly. All the boys know me and I&rsquo;ve
      known in my time fourteen of your predecessors, so I may as well know you.
      You&rsquo;re from Pittsburg, I hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sit down, Mr. Hammerly. Do you know Pittsburg at all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Borden, who keeps the gambling den on X street, is an old
      friend of mine. Do you happen to know how old Borden&rsquo;s getting
      along?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his place was raided and closed up by the police.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the old man&rsquo;s luck. Same thing in Kansas
      City.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Hammerly, do you know of any gambling houses in
      this city?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless you, haven&rsquo;t the boys taken you round yet? Well,
      now, that&rsquo;s inhospitable. Mellish&rsquo;s is the best place in town.
      I&rsquo;m going up there now. If you come along with me I&rsquo;ll give
      you the knock-down at the door and you&rsquo;ll have no trouble after
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; said McCrasky, reaching for his hat,
      and so the innocent Hammerly led the lamb into the lion&rsquo;s den.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky, unaccustomed to the sight, was somewhat bewildered with the
      rapidity of the play. There was a sort of semicircular table, around the
      outside rim of which were sitting as many men as could be comfortably
      placed there. A man at the inside of the table handled the cards. He
      flicked out one to each player, face downward, with an expertness and
      speed that dazzled McCrasky. Next he dealt out one to each player face
      upward and people put sums of money on the table beside their cards, after
      looking at them. There was another deal and so on, but the stranger found
      it impossible to understand or follow the game. He saw money being raked
      in and paid out rapidly and over the whole affair was a solemn decorum
      that he had not been prepared for. He had expected fierce oaths and the
      drawing of revolvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Mellish,&rdquo; said the innocent Hammerly, &ldquo;let me
      introduce you to the new local editor of the Argus. I didn&rsquo;t catch
      your name,&rdquo; he said in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s McCrasky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McCrasky; Mr. Mellish. Mellish is proprietor here and you&rsquo;ll
      find him a first-rate fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to meet you,&rdquo; said Mellish quietly; &ldquo;any
      friend of Hammerly&rsquo;s is welcome. Make yourself at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edging away from the two, Mellish said in a quick whisper to Sotty, the
      bartender: &ldquo;Go and tell the doorkeeper to warn Thompson, or any of
      the rest of the Argus boys, that their boss is in here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At 12 o&rsquo;clock that night the local editor sat in his room. &ldquo;Is
      that you, Thompson?&rdquo; he shouted, as he heard a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir;&rdquo; answered Thompson, coming into the presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door, Thompson. Now I have a big thing on for to-night,
      but it must be done quietly. I&rsquo;ve unearthed a gambling den in full
      blast. It will be raided to-night at 2 o&rsquo;clock. I want you to be on
      the ground with Murren; will you need anybody else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on how much you wish to make of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make it the feature of to-morrow&rsquo;s paper. I think
      we three can manage, but bring some of the rest if you like. The place is
      run by a man named Mellish. Now, if you boys kept your eyes open you would
      know more of what is going on in your own city than you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t all had the advantage of metropolitan training,&rdquo;
      said Thompson humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go there with the police. You and Murren had better be on
      the ground, but don&rsquo;t go too soon, and don&rsquo;t make yourselves
      conspicuous or they might take alarm. Here is the address. You had better
      take it down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll find the place all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then
      Thompson thought a moment and pulled himself together. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;
      he said, carefully noting down the street and number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment of police drew up in front of the place a few minutes
      before 2 o&rsquo;clock. The streets were deserted, and so silent were the
      blue coats that the footsteps of a belated wayfarer sounded sharply in the
      night air from the stone pavement of a distant avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; said McCrasky to the man in charge of the
      police, &ldquo;that there is not a private entrance somewhere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly there is,&rdquo; was the impatient reply: &ldquo;Sergeant
      McCollum and four men are stationed in the alley behind. We know our
      business, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky thought this was a snub, and he was right. He looked around in
      the darkness for his reporters. He found them standing together in a
      doorway on the opposite side of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been here long?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murren was gloomy and did not answer. The religious editor removed his
      corn-cob and said briefly; &ldquo;About ten minutes, sir.&rdquo; Thompson
      was gazing with interest at the dark building across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen nobody come out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. On the contrary, about half a dozen have gone up that
      stairway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the place, sir?&rdquo; asked Thompson with the lamb-like
      innocence of the criminal reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, upstairs there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; said the religious editor. &ldquo;Thompson
      insisted it was next door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said McCrasky, &ldquo;the police are moving at
      last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A big bell in the neighborhood solemnly struck two slow strokes, and all
      over the city the hour sounded in various degrees of tone and speed. A
      whistle rang out and was distantly answered. The police moved quickly and
      quietly up the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you tickets, gentlemen,&rdquo; asked the man at the door
      politely; &ldquo;this is a private assembly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police,&rdquo; said the sergeant shortly, &ldquo;stand aside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the police were astonished at the sight which met their gaze, their
      faces did not show it. But McCrasky had not such control over his features
      and he looked dumbfounded. The room was the same, undoubtedly, but there
      was not the vestige of a card to be seen. There were no tables, and even
      the bar had disappeared. The chairs were nicely arranged and most of them
      were occupied. At the further end of the room Pony Rowell stood on a
      platform or on a box or some elevation, and his pale, earnest face was
      lighted up with the enthusiasm of the public speaker. He was saying:
      &ldquo;On the purity of the ballot, gentlemen, depends the very life of
      the republic. That every man should be permitted, without interference or
      intimidation, to cast his vote, and that every vote so cast should be
      honestly counted is, I take it, the desire of all who now listen to my
      words.&rdquo; (Great applause, during which Pony took a sip from a glass
      that may have contained water.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The police had come in so quietly that no one, apparently, had noticed
      their entrance, except that good man Mellish, who hurried forward to
      welcome the intruders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a seat?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We are having a
      little political talk from Mr. Rowell, sergeant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather an unusual hour, Mr. Mellish,&rdquo; said the sergeant
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a little late,&rdquo; admitted Mellish, as if the idea had
      not occurred to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police who had come in by the back entrance appeared at the other end
      of the room and it was evident that Rowell&rsquo;s oration had come to an
      untimely end. Pony looked grieved and hurt, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have to search the premises, Mr. Mellish,&rdquo; said the
      sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish gave them every assistance, but nothing was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the four men walked back together to the Argus office, McCrasky was
      very indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will expose the police to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
      evidently gave Mellish the tip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Thompson. &ldquo;We will say
      nothing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget yourself, Mr. Thompson. It rests with me to say what
      shall go on the local page. Not with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget myself,&rdquo; answered Thompson sadly;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just remembered myself. The Directors of the Argus
      appointed me local editor yesterday. Didn&rsquo;t they tell you about it?
      That&rsquo;s just like them. They forgot to mention the fact to Corbin
      that he had been superseded and the manager went off fishing after
      appointing Jonsey local editor, so that for a week we had two local
      editors, each one countermanding the orders of the other. It was an awful
      week. You remember it, Murren?&rdquo; Murren&rsquo;s groan seemed to
      indicate that his recollection of the exciting time was not a pleasant
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case of doubt,&rdquo; murmured the religious editor, this time
      without removing his corn-cob, &ldquo;obey the orders of the new man where
      the Argus is concerned. Thompson, old man, I&rsquo;m wid you. When did the
      blow fall?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; said Thompson, almost with a sob;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dismissed within a month, so I am rather sorry. I
      liked working on the Argus&mdash;as a reporter. I never looked for such
      ill luck as promotion. But we all have our troubles, haven&rsquo;t we,
      Mac?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McCrasky did not answer. He is now connected with some paper in Texas.

    <h2>
      STRIKING BACK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      George Streeter was in Paris, because he hoped and expected to meet Alfred
      Davison there. He knew that Davison was going to be in Paris for at least
      a fortnight, and he had a particular reason for wishing to come across him
      in the streets of that city rather than in the streets of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streeter was a young author who had published several books, and who was
      getting along as well as could be expected, until suddenly he met a check.
      The check was only a check as far as his own self-esteem was concerned;
      for it did not in the least retard the sale of his latest book, but rather
      appeared to increase it. The check was unexpected, for where he had looked
      for a caress, he received a blow. The blow was so well placed, and so
      vigorous, that at first it stunned him. Then he became unreasonably angry.
      He resolved to strike back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The review of his book in the Argus was vigorously severe, and perhaps
      what maddened him more than anything else was the fact that, in spite of
      his self-esteem he realized the truth of the criticism. If his books had
      been less successful, or if he had been newer as an author, he might
      possibly have set himself out to profit by the keen thrusts given him by
      the Argus. He might have remembered that although Tennyson struck back at
      Christopher North, calling him rusty, crusty, and musty, yet the poet
      eliminated from later editions all blemishes which musty Christopher had
      pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streeter resolved to strike back with something more tangible than a
      sarcastic verse. He quite admitted, even to himself, that a critic had
      every right to criticise&mdash;that was what he was for&mdash;but he
      claimed that a man who pretended to be an author&rsquo;s friend and who
      praised his books to his face, had no right to go behind his back and pen
      a criticism so scathing as that which appeared in the Argus: for Streeter
      knew that Alfred Davison had written the criticism in the Argus, and
      Davison had posed as his friend; and had pretended as well, that he had a
      great admiration for Streeter&rsquo;s books.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Streeter walked down the Boulevard des Italians, he saw, seated in
      front of a café, the man whom he hoped to meet: and furthermore, he was
      pleased to see that the man had a friend with him. The recognition of
      author and critic was mutual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Streeter,&rdquo; cried Davison; &ldquo;when did you come
      over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left London yesterday,&rdquo; answered Streeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sit down and have something with us,&rdquo; said Davison,
      cordially. &ldquo;Streeter, this is my friend Harmon. He is an exile and a
      resident in Paris, and, consequently, likes to meet his countrymen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Streeter, &ldquo;he is probably well
      acquainted with the customs of the place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; returned Davison; &ldquo;he has become so much of a
      Frenchman&mdash;he has been so contaminated, if I may put it that way&mdash;that
      I believe quite recently he was either principal or second in a duel. By
      the way, which was it, Harmon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely a second,&rdquo; answered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in duelling myself,&rdquo; continued Davison:
      &ldquo;it seems to me an idiotic custom, and so futile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; replied Streeter, curtly;
      &ldquo;there is no reason why a duel should be futile, and there seem to
      be many reasons why a duel might be fought. There are many things, worse
      than crimes, which exist in all countries, and for which there is no
      remedy except calling a man out; misdemeanors, if I may so term them, that
      the law takes no cognisance of; treachery, for instance;&mdash;a person
      pretending to be a man&rsquo;s friend, and then the first chance he gets,
      stabbing him in the back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmon nodded his approval of these sentiments, while Davison said
      jauntily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that! It seems to me these things,
      which I suppose undoubtedly exist, should not be made important by taking
      much notice of them. What will you have to drink, Streeter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me a liqueur of brandy,&rdquo; said Streeter to the garçon
      who stood ready to take the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the waiter returned with a small glass, into which he poured the
      brandy with the deftness of a Frenchman, filling it so that not a drop
      more could be added, and yet without allowing the glass to overflow,
      Streeter pulled out his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Davison; &ldquo;you are not going to pay for
      this&mdash;you are drinking with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay for my own drinks,&rdquo; said Streeter, surlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when I invite you to drink with me,&rdquo; protested the
      critic. &ldquo;I pay for this brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, take it, then!&rdquo; said Streeter, picking up the
      little glass and dashing the contents in the face of Davison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davison took out his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean by that, Streeter?&rdquo; he asked, as
      the color mounted to his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streeter took out his card and pencilled a word or two on the pasteboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is my Paris address. If you do not
      know what I mean by that, ask your friend here; he will inform you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that the novelist arose, bowed to the two, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to his hotel, after a stroll along the brilliantly-
      lighted Boulevards, he found waiting for him Mr. Harmon and a Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you would come so soon,&rdquo; said Streeter, &ldquo;otherwise
      I would not have kept you waiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; replied Harmon; &ldquo;we have not
      waited long. Affairs of this kind require prompt action. An insult lasts
      but twenty-four hours, and my friend and principal has no desire to put
      you to the inconvenience of repeating your action of this evening. We are
      taking it for granted that you have a friend prepared to act for you; for
      your conduct appeared to be premeditated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; answered Streeter; &ldquo;I have two
      friends to whom I shall be pleased to introduce you. Come this way, if you
      will be so kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminaries were speedily arranged, and the meeting was to take
      place next morning at daylight, with pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that everything was settled, the prospect did not look quite so
      pleasant to Streeter as it had done when he left London. Davison had asked
      for no explanation; but that, of course, could be accounted for, because
      this critical sneak must be well aware of the reason for the insult.
      Still, Streeter had rather expected that he would perhaps have simulated
      ignorance, and on receiving enlightenment might have avoided a meeting to
      apologizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, Streeter resolved to make a night of it. He left his friends to
      arrange for a carriage, and see to all that was necessary, while he donned
      his war-paint and departed for a gathering to which he had been invited,
      and where he was to meet many of his countrymen and countrywomen, in a
      fashionable part of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hostess appeared to be overjoyed at seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so late,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I was afraid
      something had occurred to keep you from coming altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have prevented me from coming,&rdquo; said Streeter,
      gallantly, &ldquo;where Mrs. Woodford is hostess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is very nice of you, Mr. Streeter!&rdquo; answered the
      lady; &ldquo;but I must not stand here talking with you, for I have
      promised to introduce you to Miss Neville, who wishes very much to meet
      you. She is a great admirer of yours, and has read all your books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not very many of them,&rdquo; said Streeter, with a
      laugh; &ldquo;and such as they are, I hope Miss Neville thinks more of
      them than I do myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all know how modest authors are!&rdquo; replied his hostess,
      leading him away to be introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Neville was young and pretty, and she was evidently pleased to meet
      the rising young author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long wanted to see you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have a
      talk with you about your books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Streeter, &ldquo;but perhaps we
      might choose something more profitable to talk about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that. Doubtless you have been accustomed to
      hear only the nice things people say about you. That is the misfortune of
      many authors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a misfortune,&rdquo; answered Streeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a writer needs is somebody to tell him the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Miss Neville, &ldquo;that is another thing I am not
      so sure about. Mrs. Woodford has told you, I suppose, that I have read all
      your books? Did she add that I detested them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Streeter was not able to conceal the fact that this remark caused him
      some surprise. He laughed uneasily, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Mrs. Woodford led me to believe that you had liked
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned back in her chair, and looked at him with half-closed
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mrs. Woodford does not know. It
      is not likely that I would tell her I detested your books while I asked
      for an introduction to you. She took it for granted that I meant to say
      pleasant things to you, whereas I had made up my mind to do the exact
      reverse. No one would be more shocked than Mrs. Woodford&mdash;unless,
      perhaps, it is yourself&mdash;if she knew I was going to speak frankly
      with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not shocked,&rdquo; said the young man, seriously; &ldquo;I
      recognize that there are many things in my books that are blemishes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said the frank young
      woman; &ldquo;because if you did you would not repeat the faults in book
      after book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can but do his best,&rdquo; said Streeter, getting annoyed in
      spite of himself, for no man takes kindly to the candid friend. &ldquo;A
      man can but do his best, as Hubert said, whose grandsire drew a longbow at
      Hastings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Miss Neville, &ldquo;a man can but do his
      best, although we should remember that the man who said that, said it just
      before he was defeated. What I feel is that you are not doing your best,
      and that you will not do your best until some objectionable person like
      myself has a good serious talk with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin the serious talk,&rdquo; said Streeter; &ldquo;I am ready and
      eager to listen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read the review of your latest book which appeared in the
      Argus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Streeter, somewhat startled&mdash;the thought of
      the meeting that was so close, which he had forgotten for the moment,
      flashing over him. &ldquo;Yes, I did; and I had the pleasure of meeting
      the person who wrote it this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Neville almost jumped in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did not intend you to know that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who
      told you? How did you find out that I wrote reviews for the Argus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Streeter, astonished in his turn. &ldquo;Do you
      mean to say that you wrote that review?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Neville sank back in her chair with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my impetuosity has, as the Americans
      say, given me away. After all, you did not know I was the writer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Davison was the writer. I had it on the very best
      authority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Davison!&rdquo; said Miss Neville, laughing, &ldquo;why, he is
      one of the best and staunchest friends you have: and so am I, for that
      matter&mdash; indeed, I am even more your friend than Mr. Davison; for I
      think you <i>can</i> do good work, while Mr. Davison is foolish enough to
      believe you are doing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in the conversation Streeter looked hurriedly at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; said Miss Neville; &ldquo;this conversation is
      not to your taste. You are going to plead an appointment&mdash;as if
      anyone could have an appointment at this hour in the morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Streeter, &ldquo;I have; and I must bid
      you good-bye. But I assure you that my eyes have been opened, and that I
      have learned a lesson to-night which I will not soon forget. I hope I may
      have the pleasure of meeting you again, and continuing this conversation.
      Perhaps some time I may tell you why I have to leave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Streeter found his friends waiting for him. He knew it was no use trying
      to see Davison before the meeting. There was a long drive ahead of them,
      and it was grey daylight when they reached the ground, where they found
      the other party waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each man took his place and the pistol that was handed to him. When the
      word &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; was given, Streeter dropped his hand to his side.
      Davison stood with his pistol still pointed, but he did not fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you shoot, George?&rdquo; said Davison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmon, at this point, rebuked his principal, and said he must have no
      communication with the other except through a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Davison, impatiently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend
      to know the rules of this idiotic game!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Streeter stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely wished to give you the opportunity of firing at me if you
      cared to do so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and now I desire to apologize for
      my action at the café. I may say that what I did was done under a
      misapprehension. Anything that I can do to make reparation I am willing to
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Davison; &ldquo;nothing
      more need be said. I am perfectly satisfied. Let us get back to the city;
      I find it somewhat chilly out here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Harmon, with a sigh, &ldquo;Englishmen have
      the cheek to talk of the futility of French duels!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CRANDALL&rsquo;S CHOICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Crandall sat at his office desk and thought the situation over.
      Everybody had gone and he was in the office alone. Crandall was rather
      tired and a little sleepy, so he was inclined to take a gloomy view of
      things. Not that there was anything wrong with his business; in fact, it
      was in a first-rate condition so far as it went, but it did not go far
      enough; that was what John thought as he brooded over his affairs. He was
      making money, of course, but the trouble was that he was not making it
      fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thought of these things John gradually and imperceptibly went to
      sleep, and while he slept he dreamt a dream. It would be quite easy to
      pretend that the two persons who came to him in the vision, actually
      entered the office and that he thought them regular customers or something
      of that sort, while at the end of the story, when everybody was
      bewildered, the whole matter might be explained by announcing the fact
      that it was all a dream, but this account being a true and honest one, no
      such artifice will be used and at the very beginning the admission is made
      that John was the victim of a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dream two very beautiful ladies approached him. One was richly
      dressed and wore the most dazzling jewelry. The other was clad in plain
      attire. At first, the dreaming Mr. Crandall thought, or dreamt he thought,
      that the richly dressed one was the prettier. She was certainly very
      attractive, but, as she came closer, John imagined that much of her beauty
      was artificial. He said to himself that she painted artistically perhaps,
      but at any rate she laid it on rather thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the other there was no question. She was a beauty, and what
      loveliness she possessed was due to the bounties of Providence and not to
      the assistance of the chemist. She was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Crandall,&rdquo; she said, in the sweetest of voices, &ldquo;we
      have come here together so that you may choose between us. Which one will
      you have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Crandall, so much surprised at the unblushing
      proposal that he nearly awoke himself, &ldquo;bless me, don&rsquo;t you
      know that I am married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; answered the fair
      young lady, with the divinest of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Crandall. &ldquo;If you had the
      pleasure of meeting Mrs. Crandall I think you would find that it did&mdash;very
      much indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are not mortals; we are spirits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you? Well, of course that makes a difference,&rdquo;
      replied Mr. Crandall much relieved, for he began to fear from the turn the
      conversation had taken that he was in the presence of two writers of
      modern novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady,&rdquo; continued the first speaker, &ldquo;is the spirit
      of wealth. If you choose her you will be a very rich man before you die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; cried Crandall. &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then I won&rsquo;t be long making my choice. I choose her, of
      course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know who I am. Perhaps when you know, you may
      wish to reverse your decision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are the spirit of power or of fame or something of
      that sort. I am not an ambitious person; money is good enough for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am the spirit of health. Think well before you make your
      choice. Many have rejected me, and afterwards, have offered all their
      possessions fruitlessly, hoping to lure me to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Crandall, with some hesitation. &ldquo;You are
      a very pleasant young person to have around the house. But why cannot I
      have both of you? How does <i>that</i> strike you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, but I am not permitted to give you the choice of
      both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is that? Many people are allowed to choose both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that; still we must follow our instructions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that is the case, without wishing to offend you in the
      least, I think I will stand by my first choice. I choose wealth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this the other lady advanced toward him and smiled somewhat
      triumphantly as she held out her hand. Crandall grasped it and the first
      spirit sighed. Just as the spirit of wealth seemed about to speak, there
      was a shake at the office door, and Mr. John Crandall saw the spirits fade
      away. He rubbed his eyes and said to himself: &ldquo;By George! I have
      been asleep. What a remarkably vivid dream that was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he yawned and stretched his arms above his head, the impatient rattle
      at the door told him that at least was not a part of the dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arose and unlocked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Bullion,&rdquo; he said, as that solid man came in.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, aren&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for that matter, so are you. You must have been absorbed in
      your accounts or you would have heard me sooner. I thought I would have to
      shake the place down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, the policeman sometimes tries the door and I
      thought at first it was he. Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks! Don&rsquo;t care if I do. Busy tonight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just got through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how are things going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, slowly as usual. Slowly because we have not facilities enough,
      but we&rsquo;ve got all the work we can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it pay you for what work you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;m not in this business as a philanthropist, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t suppose you were. Now, see here, Crandall, I
      think you have a good thing of it here and one of the enterprises that if
      extended would develop into a big business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. But what am I to do? I&rsquo;ve practically no capital
      to enlarge the business, and I don&rsquo;t care to mortgage what I have
      and pay a high rate of interest when, just at the critical moment, we
      might have a commercial crisis and I would then lose everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right; quite right, and a safe principle. Well, that&rsquo;s
      what I came to see you about. I have had my eye on you and this factory
      for some time. Now, if you want capital I will furnish it on the condition
      that an accountant of mine examines the books and finds everything
      promising a fair return for enlarging the business. Of course I take your
      word for the state of affairs all right enough, but business is business,
      you know, and besides I want to get an expert opinion on how much
      enlargement it will stand. I suppose you could manage a manufactory ten or
      twenty times larger as easily as you do this one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Mr. Crandall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you say to my coming round to-morrow at 9 with my man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would suit me all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Crandall walked home a very much elated man that night.
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor,&rdquo; said the patient in a very weak voice, &ldquo;what
      is the verdict!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just as I said before. You will have to take a rest. You know
      I predicted this breakdown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me something that will fix me up temporarily?
      It is almost imperative that I should stay on just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. It has been so for the last five years. You forget
      that in that time you have been fixed up temporarily on several occasions.
      Now, I will get you &lsquo;round so that you can travel in a few days and
      then I insist on a sea voyage or a quiet time somewhere on the continent.
      You will have to throw off business cares entirely. There are no ifs or
      buts about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, doctor. I don&rsquo;t see how I am to leave at this
      time. I have been as bad as this a dozen times before. <i>You</i> know
      that. I&rsquo;m just a little fagged out and when I go back to the office
      I can take things easier. You see, we have a big South American contract
      on hand that I am very anxious about. New business, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you could draw your cheque for a pretty large amount, Mr.
      Crandall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can. If money can bridge the thing over, I will arrange it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, money can&rsquo;t. What I wanted to say was that if, instead
      of having a large sum in the bank, you had overdrawn your account about as
      much as the bank would stand, would you be surprised if your cheque were
      not honored?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is your state physically. You&rsquo;ve overdrawn your
      vitality account. You&rsquo;ve got to make a deposit. You must take a
      vacation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other time, doctor. I&rsquo;ll go sure, as soon as this
      contract is off. Upon my word I will. You needn&rsquo;t shake your head. A
      vacation just now would only aggravate the difficulty. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have a moment&rsquo;s peace knowing this South American business might be
      bungled. I&rsquo;d worry myself to death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral of Mr. Crandall was certainly one of the most splendid
      spectacles the city had seen for many a day. The papers all spoke highly
      of the qualities of the dead manufacturer, whose growth had been typical
      of the growth of the city. The eloquent minister spoke of the inscrutable
      ways of Providence in cutting off a man in his prime, and in the very
      height of his usefulness.

    <h2>
      THE FAILURE OF BRADLEY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 The skater lightly laughs and glides,
                   Unknowing that beneath the ice
                   On which he carves his fair device
                 A stiffened corpse in silence glides.

                 It glareth upward at his play;
                   Its cold, blue, rigid fingers steal
                   Beneath the tracings of his heel.
                 It floats along and floats away.

                                       &mdash;Unknown Poem.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had the courage,&rdquo; said Bradley, as he looked over
      the stone parapet of the embankment at the dark waters of the Thames as
      they flashed for a moment under the glitter of the gaslight and then
      disappeared in the black night to flash again farther down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely I would struggle to get out again the moment I went
      over,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;But if no help came it would
      all be done with, in a minute. Two minutes perhaps. I&rsquo;ll warrant
      those two minutes would seem an eternity. I would see a hundred ways of
      making a living, if I could only get out again. Why can&rsquo;t I see one
      now while I <i>am</i> out. My father committed suicide, why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I? I suppose it runs in the family. There seems to come a time when it is
      the only way out. I wonder if he hesitated? I&rsquo;m a coward, that&rsquo;s
      the trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the man slowly climbed on the top of the
      stone wall and then paused again. He looked with a shudder at the gloomy
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he cried aloud, and was about to slide
      down, when a hand grasped his arm and a voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> will you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of the gas-lamp Bradley saw a man whose face seemed familiar
      and although he thought rapidly, &ldquo;Where have I seen that man before?&rdquo;
      he could not place him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Bradley sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do
      nothing of that kind, if I were you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t. You have everything that I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;food,
      clothes, shelter. Certainly you wouldn&rsquo;t. Why should you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you, if it comes to that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because ten shillings stands between me and a job. That&rsquo;s
      why, if you want to know. There&rsquo;s eight shillings railway fare, a
      shilling for something to eat to-night and a shilling for something in the
      morning. But I haven&rsquo;t the ten shillings. So that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I give you the ten shillings what assurance have I that you will
      not go and get drunk on it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all. I have not asked you for ten shillings, nor for one. I
      have simply answered your question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. I will give you a pound if you will take it, and so
      if unfortunately you spent half of it in cheering yourself, you will still
      have enough left to get that job. What is the job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a carpenter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to the pound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it gladly. But, mind you, I am not a beggar. I will
      take it if you give me your address, so that I may send it back to you
      when I earn it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Bradley had come down on the pavement. The other man laughed
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree to that. You are welcome to the money. More if you
      like. I merely doubled the sum you mentioned to provide for anything
      unseen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you let me return it, I will not take the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have perfect confidence in your honesty. If I had not, I would
      not offer the money. I cannot give you my address, or, rather, I will not.
      If you will pay the pound to some charity or will give it to someone who
      is in need, I am more than satisfied. If you give it to the right man and
      tell him to do the same, the pound will do more good than ever it will in
      my pocket or in my usual way of spending it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are you to know I will do that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am considered rather a good judge of men. I am certain you will
      do what you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the money. I doubt if there is anyone in London
      to-night who needs it much worse than I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley looked after the disappearing figure of the man who had befriended
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen that man somewhere before,&rdquo; he said to himself.
      But in that he was wrong. He hadn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Wealth is most unevenly and most unfairly divided. All of us admit that,
      but few of us agree about the remedy. Some of the best minds of the
      century have wrestled with this question in vain. &ldquo;The poor ye have
      always with you&rdquo; is as true to-day as it was 1800 years ago. Where
      so many are in doubt, it is perhaps a comfort to meet men who have no
      uncertainty as to the cause and the remedy. Such a body of men met in a
      back room off Soho Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are waiting for you, Bradley,&rdquo; said the chairman, as the
      carpenter took his place and the doors were locked. He looked better than
      he had done a year before on the Thames embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m late, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. They are
      rushing things at the exhibition grounds. The time is short now, and they
      are beginning to be anxious for fear everything will not be ready in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said one of the small group, &ldquo;we are
      slaves and must be late or early as our so-called masters choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is extra pay,&rdquo; said Bradley with a smile, as he
      took a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; said the chairman, rapping on the desk, &ldquo;we
      will now proceed to business. The secret committee has met and made a
      resolution. After the lots are drawn it will be my task to inform the man
      chosen what the job is. It is desirable that as few as possible, even
      among ourselves, should know who the man is, who has drawn the marked
      paper. Perhaps it may be my own good fortune to be the chosen man. One of
      the papers is marked with a cross. Whoever draws that paper is to
      communicate with me at my room within two days. He is to come alone. It is
      commanded by the committee that no man is to look at his paper until he
      leaves this room and then to examine it in secret. He is bound by his oath
      to tell no one at any time whether or not he is the chosen man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers were put into a hat and each man in the room drew one. The
      chairman put his in his pocket, as did the others. The doors were unlocked
      and each man went to his home, if he had one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening Bradley called at the room of the chairman and said: &ldquo;There
      is the marked paper I drew last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibition building was gay with bunting and was sonorous with the
      sounds of a band of music. The machinery that would not stop for six
      months was still motionless, for it was to be started in an hour&rsquo;s
      time by His Highness. His Highness and suite had not yet arrived but the
      building was crowded by a well-dressed throng of invited guests&mdash;the
      best in the land as far as fame, title or money was concerned. Underneath
      the grand stand where His Highness and the distinguished guests were to
      make speeches and where the finger of nobility was to press the electric
      button, Bradley walked anxiously about, with the same haggard look on his
      face that was there the night he thought of slipping into the Thames. The
      place underneath was a wilderness of beams and braces. Bradley&rsquo;s
      wooden tool chest stood on the ground against one of the timbers. The
      foremen came through and struck a beam or a brace here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is all right,&rdquo; he said to Bradley. &ldquo;There
      will be no trouble, even if it was put up in a hurry, and in spite of the
      strain that will be on it to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley was not so sure of that, but he said nothing. When the foreman
      left him alone, he cautiously opened the lid of his tool chest and removed
      the carpenter&rsquo;s apron which covered something in the bottom. This
      something was a small box with a clockwork arrangement and a miniature
      uplifted hammer that hung like the sword of Damocles over a little copper
      cap. He threw the apron over it again, closed the lid of the chest, leaned
      against one of the timbers, folded his arms and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there was a tremendous cheer and the band struck up. &ldquo;He
      is coming,&rdquo; said Bradley to himself, closing his lips tighter.
      &ldquo;Carpenter,&rdquo; cried the policeman putting in his head through
      the little wooden door at the foot of the stage, &ldquo;come here, quick.
      You can get a splendid sight of His Highness as he comes up the passage.&rdquo;
      Bradley walked to the opening and gazed at the distinguished procession
      coming toward him. Suddenly he grasped the arm of the policeman like a
      vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that man in the robes&mdash;at the head of the procession?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? That is His Highness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley gasped for breath. He recognized His Highness as the man he had
      met on the embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said to the policeman, who looked at him
      curiously. Then he went under the grand stand among the beams and braces
      and leaned against one of the timbers with knitted brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments he stepped to his chest, pulled off the apron and
      carefully lifted out the machine. With a quick jerk he wrenched off the
      little hammer and flung it from him. The machinery inside whirred for a
      moment with a soft purr like a clock running down. He opened the box and
      shook out into his apron a substance like damp sawdust. He seemed puzzled
      for a moment what to do with it. Finally he took it out and scattered it
      along the grass-grown slope of a railway cutting. Then he returned to his
      tool chest, took out a chisel and grimly felt its edge with his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was admitted on all hands that His Highness never made a better speech
      in his life than on the occasion of the opening of that exhibition. He
      touched lightly on the country&rsquo;s unexampled prosperity, of which the
      marvelous collection within those walls was an indication. He alluded to
      the general contentment that reigned among the classes to whose handiwork
      was due the splendid examples of human skill there exhibited. His Highness
      was thankful that peace and contentment reigned over the happy land and he
      hoped they would long continue so to reign. Then there were a good many
      light touches of humor in the discourse&mdash; touches that are so
      pleasing when they come from people in high places. In fact, the chairman
      said at the club afterwards (confidentially, of course) that the man who
      wrote His Highness&rsquo;s speeches had in that case quite outdone
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers had very full accounts of the opening of the exhibition next
      morning, and perhaps because these graphic articles occupied so much
      space, there was so little room for the announcement about the man who
      committed suicide. The papers did not say where the body was found, except
      that it was near the exhibition buildings, and His Highness never knew
      that he made that excellent speech directly over the body of a dead man.

    <h2>
      RINGAMY&rsquo;S CONVERT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnson Ringamy, the author, sat in his library gazing idly out of the
      window. The view was very pleasant, and the early morning sun brought out
      in strong relief the fresh greenness of the trees that now had on their
      early spring suits of foliage. Mr. Ringamy had been a busy man, but now,
      if he cared to take life easy, he might do so, for few books had had the
      tremendous success of his latest work. Mr. Ringamy was thinking about
      this, when the door opened, and a tall, intellectual-looking young man
      entered from the study that communicated with the library. He placed on
      the table the bunch of letters he had in his hand, and, drawing up a
      chair, opened a blank notebook that had, between the leaves, a lead pencil
      sharpened at both ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Scriver,&rdquo; said the author, also hitching up
      his chair towards the table. He sighed as he did so, for the fair spring
      prospect from the library window was much more attractive than the task of
      answering an extensive correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a large mail this morning, Scriver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good-sized one, sir. Many of them, however, are notes asking for
      your autograph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enclose stamps, do they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of them, sir; those that did not, I threw in the waste basket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. And as to the autographs you might write them this
      afternoon, if you have time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already done so, sir. I flatter myself that even your most
      intimate friend could not tell my version of your autograph from your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, the young man shoved towards the author a letter which he
      had written, and Mr. Ringamy looked at it critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Scriver, very good indeed. In fact, if I were put in the
      witness-box I am not sure that I would be able to swear that this was not
      my signature. What&rsquo;s this you have said in the body of the letter
      about sentiment? Not making me write anything sentimental, I hope. Be
      careful, my boy, I don&rsquo;t want the newspapers to get hold of anything
      that they could turn into ridicule. They are too apt to do that sort of
      thing if they get half a chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think you will find that all right,&rdquo; said the young
      man; &ldquo;still I thought it best to submit it to you before sending it
      off. You see the lady who writes has been getting up a &lsquo;Ringamy Club&rsquo;
      in Kalamazoo, and she asks you to give her an autographic sentiment which
      they will cherish as the motto of the club. So I wrote the sentence,
      &lsquo;All classes of labor should have equal compensation.&rsquo; If that
      won&rsquo;t do, I can easily change it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will do first rate&mdash;first rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is awful rot, but I thought it would please the
      feminine mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful <i>what</i> did you say, Mr. Scriver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, slush&mdash;if that expresses it better. Of course, you don&rsquo;t
      believe any such nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Johnson Ringamy frowned as he looked at his secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand you,&rdquo; he said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here, Mr. Ringamy, speaking now, not as a paid servant
      to his master, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Scriver, I won&rsquo;t have any talk like that. There is no
      master or servant idea between us. There oughtn&rsquo;t to be between
      anybody. All men are free and equal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in theory, and in my eye, as I might say if I wanted to
      make it more expressive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scriver, I cannot congratulate you on your expressive language, if
      I may call it so. But we are wandering from the argument. You were going
      to say that speaking as&mdash;&mdash;Well, go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say that, speaking as one reasonably sensible man to
      another, without any gammon about it; don&rsquo;t you think it is rank
      nonsense to hold that one class of labor should be as well compensated as
      another. Honestly now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The author sat back in his chair and gazed across the table at his
      secretary. Finally, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Scriver, you can&rsquo;t really mean what you say. You know
      that I hold that all classes of labor should have exactly the same
      compensation. The miner, the blacksmith, the preacher, the postal clerk,
      the author, the publisher, the printer&mdash;yes, the man who sweeps out
      the office, or who polishes boots, should each share alike, if this world
      were what it should be&mdash;yes, and what it <i>will</i> be. Why,
      Scriver, you surely couldn&rsquo;t have read my book&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it? why, hang it, I <i>wrote</i> it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote it? The deuce you did! I always thought I was the author
      of &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are. But didn&rsquo;t I take it all down in shorthand, and
      didn&rsquo;t I whack it out on the type-writer, and didn&rsquo;t I go over
      the proof sheets with you. And yet you ask me if I have read it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, quite right, I see what you mean. Well, if you paid as
      much attention to the arguments as you did to the mechanical production of
      the book, I should think you would not ask if I really meant what I said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose you meant it all right enough&mdash;in a way&mdash;in
      theory, perhaps, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, allow me to say that a theory which is not practical,
      is simply no theory at all. The great success of &lsquo;Gazing Upward,&rsquo;
      has been due to the fact that it is an eminently practical work. The
      nationalization of everything is not a matter of theory. The ideas
      advocated in that book, can be seen at work at any time. Look at the Army,
      look at the Post Office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, looking at things in bulk. Let us come
      down to practical details. Detail is the real test of any scheme. Take
      this volume, &lsquo;Gazing Upward.&rsquo; Now, may I ask how much this
      book has netted you up to date?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know exactly. Somewhere in the neighborhood of
      £20,000.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then. Now let us look for a moment at the method by which
      that book was produced. You walked up and down this room with your hands
      behind your back, and dictated chapter after chapter, and I sat at this
      table taking it all down in shorthand. Then you went out and took the air
      while I industriously whacked it out on the type-writer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;whacked,&rsquo; Scriver. That&rsquo;s
      twice you&rsquo;ve used it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right:&mdash;typographical error&mdash;For &lsquo;whacked&rsquo;
      read &lsquo;manipulated.&rsquo; Then you looked over the type-written
      pages, and I erased and wrote in and finally got out a perfect copy. Now I
      worked as hard&mdash;probably harder&mdash;than you did, yet the success
      of that book was entirely due to you, and not to me. Therefore it is quite
      right that you should get £20,000 and that I should get two pounds a week.
      Come now, isn&rsquo;t it? Speaking as a man of common sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking exactly in that way I say no it is not right. If the world
      were properly ruled the compensation of author and secretary would have
      been exactly the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, if you go so far as that,&rdquo; replied the Secretary,
      &ldquo;I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The author laughed, and the two men bent their energies to the
      correspondence. When the task was finished, Scriver said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to get a couple of days off, Mr. Ringamy. I have some
      private business to attend to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When could you get back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report to you on Thursday morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Not later than Thursday. I think I&rsquo;ll take a
      couple of days off myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday morning Mr. Johnson Ringamy sat in his library looking out of
      the window, but the day was not as pleasant as when he last gazed at the
      hills, and the woods, and green fields. A wild spring storm lashed the
      landscape, and rattled the raindrops against the pane. Mr. Ringamy waited
      for some time and then opened the study door and looked in. The little
      room was empty. He rang the bell, and the trim servant-girl appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Scriver come in yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the rain has kept him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Scriver said that when you come back, sir, there was a letter
      on the table as was for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so there is. Thank you, that will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The author opened the letter and read as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;MY DEAR MR. RINGAMY,&mdash;Your arguments the other day fully convinced me
that you were right, and I was wrong (&ldquo;Ah! I thought they would,&rdquo;
 murmured the author). I have therefore taken a step toward putting your
theories into practice. The scheme is an old one in commercial life,
but new in its present application, so much so that I fear it will find
no defenders except yourself, and I trust that now when I am far away
(&ldquo;Dear me, what does this mean!&rdquo; cried the author) you will show any
doubters that I acted on the principles which will govern the world
when the theories of &lsquo;Gazing Upward&rsquo; are put into practice. For fear
that all might not agree with you at present, I have taken the
precaution of going to that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no
extradition treaty forces the traveler to return&mdash;sunny Spain. You said
you could not tell my rendition of your signature from your own.
Neither could the bank cashier. My exact mutation of your signature has
enabled me to withdraw £10,000 from your bank account. Half the
profits, you know. You can send future accumulations, for the book will
continue to sell, to the address of
                                     &ldquo;ADAM SCRIVER.
<i>&ldquo;Poste Restant, Madrid, Spain&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Ringamy at once put the case in the hands of the detectives, where it
      still remains.

    <p>
      When John Armstrong stepped off the train at the Union Station, in
      Toronto, Canada, and walked outside, a small boy accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry your valise up for you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry it up for ten cents, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it up for five cents, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of my way, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy got out of the way, and John Armstrong carried the valise himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nearly half a million dollars in it, so Mr. Armstrong thought it
      best to be his own porter.

    <p>
      In the bay window of one of the handsomest residences in Rochester, New
      York, sat Miss Alma Temple, waiting for her father to come home from the
      bank. Mr. Horace Temple was one of the solid men of Rochester, and was
      president of the Temple National Bank. Although still early in December,
      the winter promised to be one of the most severe for many years, and the
      snow lay crisp and hard on the streets, but not enough for sleighing. It
      was too cold for snow, the weatherwise said. Suddenly Miss Alma drew back
      from the window with a quick flush on her face that certainly was not
      caused by the coming of her father. A dapper young man sprang lightly up
      the steps, and pressed the electric button at the door. When the young man
      entered the room a moment later Miss Alma was sitting demurely by the open
      fire. He advanced quickly toward her, and took both her outstretched hands
      in his. Then, furtively looking around the room, he greeted her still more
      affectionately, in a manner that the chronicler of these incidents, is not
      bound to particularize. However, the fact may be mentioned that whatever
      resistance the young woman thought fit to offer was of the faintest and
      most futile kind, and so it will be understood, at the beginning, that
      these two young persons had a very good understanding with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem surprised to see me,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Walter, I understood that you left last time with some
      energetically expressed resolutions never to darken our doors again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, my dear, I am sometimes a little hasty; and, in
      fact, the weather is so dark nowadays, anyhow, that a little extra
      darkness does not amount to much, and so I thought I would take the risk
      of darkening them once more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I also understood that my father made you promise, or that you
      promised voluntarily, not to see me again without his permission?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not voluntarily. Far from it. Under compulsion, I assure you. But I
      didn&rsquo;t come to see you at all. That&rsquo;s where you are mistaken.
      The seeing you is merely an accident, which I have done my best to avoid.
      Fact! The girl said, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you walk into the drawing-room,&rsquo;
      and naturally I did so. Never expected to find you here. I thought I saw a
      young lady at the window as I came up, but I got such a momentary glimpse
      that I might have been mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will leave you and not interrupt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Now I beg of you not to leave on my account, Alma. You
      know I would not put you to any trouble for the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, I am sure, Mr. Brown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed, Miss Temple. All my friends admit that. But now that
      you are here&mdash;by the way, I came to see Mr. Temple. Is he at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am expecting him every moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;m disappointed; but I guess I will bear up for
      awhile&mdash; until he comes, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought your last interview with him was not so pleasant that you
      would so soon seek another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Alma, we both lost our tempers a bit, and no good ever
      comes of that. You can&rsquo;t conduct business in a heat, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then the asking of his daughter&rsquo;s hand was business&mdash;a
      mere business proposition, was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I confess he put it that way&mdash;very strongly, too. Of
      course, with me there would have been pleasure mixed with it if he had&mdash;but
      he didn&rsquo;t. See here, Alma&mdash;tell me frankly (of course he talked
      with you about it) what objection he has to me anyhow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you consider yourself such a desirable young man that it
      astonishes you greatly that any person should have any possible objection
      to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, Alma; don&rsquo;t hit a fellow when he&rsquo;s down,
      you know. I don&rsquo;t suppose I have more conceit than the average young
      man; but then, on the other hand, I am not such a fool, despite
      appearances, as not to know that I am considered by some people as quite
      an eligible individual. I am not a pauper exactly, and your father knows
      that. I don&rsquo;t think I have many very bad qualities. I don&rsquo;t
      get drunk; I don&rsquo;t &mdash;oh, I could give quite a list of the
      things I don&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly frank enough, my eligible young man. Still you
      must not forget that my papa is considered quite an eligible
      father-in-law, if it comes to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, I admit it. How could it be otherwise when he has
      such a charming daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t mean that, Walter. You were speaking of
      wealth and so was I. Perhaps we had better change the subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, that reminds me of what I came to see you about. What
      do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see me? I thought you came to see my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;I did come to see him, of course, but
      in case I saw you, I thought I would ask you for further particulars in
      the case. I have asked you the question but you have evaded the answer.
      You did not tell me why he is so prejudiced against me. Why did he receive
      me in such a gruff manner when I spoke to him about it? It is not a
      criminal act to ask a man for his daughter. It is not, I assure you. I
      looked up the law on the subject, and a young friend of mine, who is a
      barrister, says there is no statute in the case made and provided. The law
      of the State of New York does not recognize my action as against the peace
      and prosperity of the commonwealth. Well, he received me as if I had been
      caught robbing the bank. Now I propose to know what the objection is. I am
      going to hear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Here is papa now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Alma quickly left the room, and met her father in the hall. Mr. Brown
      stood with his hands in his pockets and his back to the fire. He heard the
      gruff voice of Mr. Temple say, apparently in answer to some information
      given him by his daughter: &ldquo;Is he? What does he want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, and then the same voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will see him in the library in a few minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the courage of young Mr. Brown sank as he heard the banker&rsquo;s
      voice, and the information he had made up his mind to demand with some
      hauteur, he thought he would ask, perhaps, in a milder manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown brightened up as the door opened, but it was not Miss Alma who
      came in. The servant said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Temple is in the library, sir. Will you come this way!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed and found the banker seated at his library table, on which he
      had just placed some legal-looking papers, bound together with a thick
      rubber band. It was evident that his work did not stop when he left the
      bank. Young Brown noticed that Mr. Temple looked careworn and haggard, and
      that his manner was very different from what it had been on the occasion
      of the last interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Brown. I am glad you called. I was on the point
      of writing to you, but the subject of our talk the other night was crowded
      from my mind by more important matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Brown thought bitterly that there ought not to be matters more
      important to a father than his daughter&rsquo;s happiness, but he had the
      good sense not to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to you on that occasion with a&mdash;in a manner that was&mdash;well,
      hardly excusable, and I wish to say that I am sorry I did so. What I had
      to state might have been stated with more regard for your feelings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then may I hope, Mr. Temple, that you have changed your mind with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. What I said then&mdash;that is, the substance of what I
      said, not the manner of saying it&mdash;I still adhere to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what objection you have to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I have the same objection that I have to the majority of
      the society young men of the present day. If I make inquiries about you,
      what do I find? That you are a noted oarsman&mdash;that you have no
      profession&mdash;that your honors at college consisted in being captain of
      the football team, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, the baseball club.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same thing, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite different, I assure you, Mr. Temple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is the same to me at any rate. Now, in my time young men
      had a harder row to hoe, and they hoed it. I am what they call a self-made
      man and probably I have a harsher opinion of the young men of the present
      day than I should have. But if I had a son I would endeavor to have him
      know how to do something, and then I would see that he did it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you for stating your objection, Mr. Temple. I have
      taken my degree in Harvard law school, but I have never practiced,
      because, as the little boy said, I didn&rsquo;t have to. Perhaps if some
      one had spoken to me as you have done I would have pitched in and gone to
      work. It is not too late yet. Will you give me a chance? The position of
      cashier in your bank, for instance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of these apparently innocent words on Mr. Temple was startling.
      He sprang to his feet and brought down his clenched fist on the table with
      a vehemence that made young Mr. Brown jump. &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo;
      he cried, sternly. &ldquo;What do you mean by saying such a thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered
      Brown, but he could get no further. He thought the old man had suddenly
      gone crazy. He glared across the library table at Brown as if the next
      instant he would spring at his throat. Then the haggard look came into his
      face again, he passed his hand across his brow, and sank into his chair
      with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Brown, approaching him, &ldquo;what is the
      matter? Is there anything I can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; answered the banker, melancholy. &ldquo;You
      will excuse me I hope, I am very much troubled. I did not intend to speak
      of it, but some explanation is due to you. A month from now, if you are
      the kind of man that most of your fellows are, you will not wish to marry
      my daughter. There is every chance that at that time the doors of my bank
      will be closed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me, sir. I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and so every one thinks. I have seldom in my life trusted the
      wrong man, but this time I have done so, and the one mistake seems likely
      to obliterate all that I have succeeded in doing in a life of hard work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of any financial assistance I will be glad to help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;50,000 dollars perhaps or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have 250,000 dollars before the end of this month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and fifty thousand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. William L. Staples, the cashier of our bank, is now in
      Canada with half a million of the bank funds. No one knows it but myself
      and one or two of the directors. It is generally supposed that he has gone
      to Washington on a vacation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you put detectives on his track?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Then the theft would be made public at once. The papers
      would be full of it. There might be a run on the bank, and we would have
      to close the doors the next day. To put the detectives on his track would
      merely mean bringing disaster on our own heads. Staples is quite safe, and
      he knows it. Thanks to an idiotic international arrangement he is as free
      from danger of arrest in Canada as you are here. It is impossible to
      extradite him for stealing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think there is a law against bringing stolen money into
      Canada.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there is. It would not help us at the present moment. We
      must compromise with him, if we can find him in time. Of course, even if
      the bank closed, we would pay everything when there was time to realize.
      But that is not the point. It would mean trouble and disaster, and would
      probably result in other failures all through one man&rsquo;s rascality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it all resolves itself to this. Staples must be found quietly
      and negotiated with. Mr. Temple, let me undertake the finding of him, and
      the negotiating, also, if you will trust me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him in my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is his portrait. He is easily recognized from that. You couldn&rsquo;t
      mistake him. He is probably living at Montreal under an assumed name. He
      may have sailed for Europe. You will say nothing of this to anybody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I will leave on to-night&rsquo;s train for Montreal,
      or on the first train that goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Brown slipped the photograph into his pocket and shook hands
      with the banker. Somehow his confident, alert bearing inspired the old man
      with more hope than he would have cared to admit, for, as a general thing,
      he despised the average young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long can you hold out if this does not become public?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a month at least; probably for two or three.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t expect to hear from me too soon. I shall not risk
      writing. If there is anything to communicate, I will come myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you to take my trouble on your shoulders like
      this. I am very much obliged to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a philanthropist, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; replied young Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Mr. Brown stepped off the train at the Central Station in
      Toronto, a small boy accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry your valise up for you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Brown, handing it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do I owe you?&rdquo; he asked at the lobby of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five cents,&rdquo; said the boy promptly, and he got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown registered on the books of the hotel as John A. Walker, of Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walter Brown, of Rochester, was never more discouraged in his life
      than at the moment he wrote on the register the words, &ldquo;John A.
      Walker, Montreal.&rdquo; He had searched Montreal from one end to the
      other, but had found no trace of the man for whom he was looking. Yet,
      strange to say, when he raised his eyes from the register they met the
      face of William L. Staples, ex-cashier. It was lucky for Brown that
      Staples was looking at the words he had written, and not at himself, or he
      would have noticed Brown&rsquo;s involuntary start of surprise, and flush
      of pleasure. It was also rather curious that Mr. Brown had a dozen schemes
      in his mind for getting acquainted with Staples when he met him, and yet
      that the first advance should be made by Staples himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are from Montreal,&rdquo; said Mr. Staples, alias John
      Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my town,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a place is it in winter? Pretty lively?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Good deal of a winter city, Montreal is. How do you mean,
      business or sport?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, both. Generally where there&rsquo;s lots of business there&rsquo;s
      lots of fun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented Brown. He did not wish to
      prolong the conversation. He had some plans to make, so he followed his
      luggage up to his room. It was evident that he would have to act quickly.
      Staples was getting tired of Toronto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after Brown had his plans completed. He met Staples one evening
      in the smoking-room of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of going to Montreal?&rdquo; asked Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think of it. I don&rsquo;t know, though. Are you in business
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If you go, I could give you some letters of introduction to a
      lot of fellows who would show you some sport, that is, if you care for
      snow-shoeing, toboganning, and the like of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never went in much for athletics,&rdquo; said Staples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much for exertion myself,&rdquo; answered Brown.
      &ldquo;I come up here every winter for some ice-yachting. That&rsquo;s my
      idea of sport. I own one of the fastest ice-boats on the bay. Ever been
      out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve seen them at it a good deal. Pretty
      cold work such weather as we&rsquo;ve been having, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Better come out with me tomorrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day and the next they spun around the bay on the ice-boat. Even
      Staples, who seemed to be tired of almost everything, liked the swiftness
      and exhilaration of the iceboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, Brown walked into the bar of the hotel, where he found
      Staples standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Armstrong.&rdquo; he cried, slapping that gentleman on
      the shoulder. &ldquo;Are you in for a bit of sport? It&rsquo;s a nice
      moonlight night, and I&rsquo;m going to take a spin down to Hamilton to
      meet some chaps, and we can come back on the iceboat, or if you think it
      too late, you can stay over, and come back on the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hamilton? That&rsquo;s up the lake, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just a nice run from here. Come along&mdash;I counted on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later they were skimming along the frozen surface of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself warm and snug,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what the buffalo robes are for. I must steer, so I have to keep in the
      open. If I were you I&rsquo;d wrap up in those robes and go to sleep. I&rsquo;ll
      wake you when we&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Staples. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad
      idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General George Washington!&rdquo; said young Brown to himself.
      &ldquo;This is too soft a snap altogether. I&rsquo;m going to run him
      across the lake like a lamb. Before he opens his eyes we&rsquo;ll have
      skimmed across the frozen lake, and he&rsquo;ll find himself in the States
      again when he wakes up. The only thing now to avoid are the air-holes and
      ice-hills, and I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been over the course before and knew pretty well what was ahead of
      him. The wind was blowing stiffly straight up the lake and the boat
      silently, and swifter than the fastest express, was flying from Canada and
      lessening the distance to the American shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you getting along, Walker,&rdquo; cried Staples, rousing
      himself up. &ldquo;First rate,&rdquo; answered Brown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      soon be there, Staples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That unfortunate slip of the tongue almost cost young Mr. Brown his life.
      He had been, thinking of the man under his own name, and the name had come
      out unconsciously. He did not even notice it himself in time to prepare,
      and the next instant the thief flung himself upon him and jammed his head
      against the iron rod that guided the rudder, with such a force that the
      rudder stayed in its place and the boat flew along the ice without a
      swerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; roared the bank-robber. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      your game, is it? By the gods, I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson in the
      detective business!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Athlete as young Brown was, the suddenness of the attack, and the fact
      that Staples clutched both hands round his neck and had his knee on his
      breast, left him as powerless as an infant. Even then he did not realize
      what had caused the robber to guess his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, let me up!&rdquo; gasped Brown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      be into an air-hole and drowned in a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it, you dog! till I&rsquo;ve choked the breath out
      of your body.&rdquo; Brown wriggled his head away from the rudder iron,
      hoping that the boat would slew around, but it kept its course. He
      realized that if he was to save his life he would have to act promptly. He
      seemed to feel his tongue swell in his parched mouth. His strength was
      gone and his throat was in an iron vice. He struck out wildly with his
      feet and one fortunate kick sent the rudder almost at right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the boat flashed around into the wind. Even if a man is prepared
      for such a thing, it takes all his nerve and strength to keep him on an
      iceboat. Staples was not prepared. He launched head first into space and
      slid for a long distance on the rough ice. Brown was also flung on the ice
      and lay for a moment gasping for breath. Then he gathered himself
      together, and slipping his hand under his coat, pulled out his revolver.
      He thought at first that Staples was shamming, but a closer examination of
      him showed that the fall on the ice had knocked him senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one thing that young Mr. Brown was very anxious to know. He
      wanted to know where the money was. He had played the part of private
      detective well in Toronto, after the very best French style, and had
      searched the room of Staples in his absence, but he knew the money was not
      there nor in his valise. He knew equally well that the funds were in some
      safe deposit establishment in the city, but where he could not find out.
      He had intended to work on Staples&rsquo; fears of imprisonment when once
      he had him safe on the other side of the line. But now that the man was
      insensible, he argued that it was a good time to find whether or not he
      had a record of the place of deposit in his pocket-book. He found no such
      book in his pockets. In searching, however, he heard the rustling of paper
      apparently in the lining of his coat. Then he noticed how thickly it was
      padded. The next moment he had it ripped open, and a glance showed him
      that it was lined with bonds. Both coat and vest were padded in this way&mdash;the
      vest being filled with Bank of England notes, so the chances were that
      Staples had meditated a tour in Europe. The robber evidently put no trust
      in Safe Deposits nor banks. Brown flung the thief over on his face, after
      having unbuttoned coat and vest, doubled back his arms and pulled off
      these garments. His own, Brown next discarded, and with some difficulty
      got them on the fallen man and then put on the clothes of mammon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I call rolling in wealth.&rdquo; said Brown to
      himself. He admitted that he felt decidedly better after the change of
      clothing, cold as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buttoning his own garments on the prostrate man, Brown put a flask of
      liquor to his lips and speedily revived him. Staples sat on the ice in a
      dazed manner, and passed his hand across his brow. In the cold gleam of
      the moonlight he saw the shining barrel of Brown&rsquo;s revolver &ldquo;covering&rdquo;
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Mr. Staples. Get on board the iceboat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take me to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you go when we come to the coast if you tell me
      where the money is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you are guilty of the crime of kidnapping,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Staples, apparently with the object of gaining time. &ldquo;So you are in
      some danger of the law yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question that can be discussed later on. You came
      voluntarily, don&rsquo;t forget that fact. Where&rsquo;s the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is on deposit in the Bank of Commerce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s paper and a stylographic pen, if the ink isn&rsquo;t
      frozen&mdash; no, it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;write a cheque quickly for
      the amount payable to bearer. Hurry up, or the ink will freeze.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a smile of satisfaction on the face of Staples as he wrote the
      check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, with a counterfeited sigh. &ldquo;That is
      the amount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The check was for 480,000 dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came under the shadow of the American coast, Brown ordered his
      passenger off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can easily reach land from here, and the walk will do you good.
      I&rsquo;m going further up the lake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Staples was almost at the land he shouted through the clear night
      air: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend the money recklessly when you get it,
      Walker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of it, Staples,&rdquo; shouted back young
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    <p>
      Young Mr. Brown sprang lightly up the steps of the Temple mansion,
      Rochester, and pressed the electric button.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Temple gone to the bank yet?&rdquo; he asked the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he is in the library.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Don&rsquo;t trouble. I know the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple looked around as the young man entered, and, seeing who it was,
      sprang to his feet with a look of painful expectancy on his face. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a little present for you,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, placing a package on the
      table. &ldquo;Four hundred and seventy-eight thousand: Bank of England
      notes and United States bonds.&rdquo; The old man grasped his hand, strove
      to speak, but said nothing.
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>
      People wondered why young Mr. and Mrs. Brown went to Toronto on their
      wedding tour in the depth of winter. It was so very unusual, don&rsquo;t
      you know.

      THE SIXTH BENCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was in earnest; he was not. When that state of things exists anything
      may happen. The occurrence may be commonplace, comic, or tragic, depending
      on the temperament and experience of the woman. In this instance the
      result was merely an appointment&mdash;which both of them kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector McLane came to Paris with noble resolutions, a theory of color, and
      a small allowance. Paris played havoc with all of these. He was engaged to
      a nice girl at home, who believed him destined to become a great painter;
      a delusion which McLane shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered with great zest into the life of a Parisian art student, but
      somehow the experience did not equal his anticipations. What he had read
      in books&mdash;poetry and prose&mdash;had thrown a halo around the Latin
      Quarter, and he was therefore disappointed in finding the halo missing.
      The romance was sordid and mercenary, and after a few months of it he
      yearned for something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris you may have nearly everything&mdash;except the something better.
      It exists, of course, but it rarely falls in the way of the usually
      impecunious art student. Yet it happened that, as luck was not against the
      young man, he found it when he had abandoned the search for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane&rsquo;s theory was that art had become too sombre. The world was
      running overmuch after the subdued in color. He wanted to be able to paint
      things as they are, and was not to be deterred if his pictures were called
      gaudy. He obtained permission to set up his easel in the Church of Notre
      Dame, and in the dim light there, he endeavored to place on canvas some
      semblance of the splendor of color that came through the huge rose window
      high above him. He was discouraged to see how opaque the colors in the
      canvas were as compared with the translucent hues of the great window. As
      he leaned back with a sigh of defeat, his wandering eyes met, for one
      brief instant, something more beautiful than the stained glass, as the
      handiwork of God must always be more beautiful than the handiwork of man.
      The fleeting glimpse was of a melting pair of dark limpid eyes, which,
      meeting his, were instantly veiled, and then he had a longer view of the
      sweet face they belonged to. It was evident that the young girl had been
      admiring his work, which was more than he could hope to have the professor
      at Julien&rsquo;s do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lack of assurance was never considered, even by his dearest friend, to be
      among McLane&rsquo;s failings. He rose from his painting stool, bowed and
      asked her if she would not sit down for a moment; she could see the&mdash;
      the&mdash;painting so much better. The girl did not answer, but turned a
      frightened look upon him, and fled under the wing of her kneeling duenna,
      who had not yet finished her devotions. It was evident that the prayers of
      the girl had been briefer than those of the old woman in whose charge she
      was. Where the need is greatest the prayer is often the shortest. McLane
      had one more transitory glimpse of those dark eyes as he held open the
      swinging door. The unconscious woman and the conscious girl passed out of
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how it began.

      The painting of the colored window of Notre Dame now occupied almost all
      the time at the disposal of Hector McLane. No great work is ever
      accomplished without unwearied perseverance. It was remarkable that the
      realization of this truth came upon him just after he had definitely made
      up his mind to abandon the task. Before he allowed the swinging door to
      close he had resolved to pursue his study in color. It thus happened,
      incidentally, that he saw the young girl again, always at the same hour,
      and always with the same companion. Once he succeeded, unnoticed by the
      elder, in slipping a note into her hand, which he was pleased and
      flattered to see she retained and concealed. Another day he had the joy of
      having a few whispered words with her in the dim shadow of one of the
      gigantic pillars. After that, progress was comparatively easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Yvette, he learned, and he was amused to find with what
      expert dexterity a perfectly guileless and innocent little creature such
      as she was, managed to elude the vigilance of the aged and experienced
      woman who had her in charge. The stolen interviews usually took place in
      the little park behind Notre Dame. There they sat on the bench facing the
      fountain, or walked up and down on the crunching gravel under the trees.
      In the afternoons they walked in the secluded part of the park, in the
      shadow of the great church. It was her custom to send him dainty little
      notes telling him when she expected to be in the park, giving the number
      of the bench, for sometimes the duenna could not be eluded, and was seated
      there with Yvette. On these occasions McLane had to content himself with
      gazing from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so much in earnest that the particular emotion which occupied the
      place of conscience in McLane&rsquo;s being, was troubled. He thought of
      the nice girl at home, and fervently hoped nothing of this would ever
      reach her ears. No matter how careful a man is, chance sometimes plays him
      a scurvy trick. McLane remembered instances, and regretted the world was
      so small. Sometimes a cry of recognition from one on the pavement to a
      comrade in the park, shouted through the iron railings, sent a shiver
      through McLane. Art students had an uncomfortable habit of roaming
      everywhere, and they were boisterous in hailing an acquaintance. Besides,
      they talked, and McLane dreaded having his little intrigue the joke of the
      school. At any moment an objectionable art student might drop into the
      park to sketch the fountain, or the nurses and children, or the back of
      the cathedral at one end of the park, or even the low, gloomy, unimposing
      front of the Morgue at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an easy-going young fellow, who hated trouble, and perhaps, knowing
      that the inevitable day of reckoning was approaching, this accounted for
      the somewhat tardy awakening of his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sometimes thought it would be best simply to leave Paris without any
      explanation, but he remembered that she knew his address, having written
      to him often, and that by going to the school she could easily find out
      where his home was. So if there was to be a scene it was much better that
      it should take place in Paris, rather than where the nice girl lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nerved himself up many times to make the explanation and bring down the
      avalanche, but when the time came he postponed it. But the inevitable
      ultimately arrives. He had some difficulty at first in getting her to
      understand the situation clearly, but when he at last succeeded there was
      no demonstration. She merely kept her eyes fixed on the gravel and gently
      withdrew her hand from his. To his surprise she did not cry, nor even
      answer him, but walked silently to and fro with downcast eyes in the
      shadow of the church. No one, he said, would ever occupy the place in his
      heart that she held. He was engaged to the other girl, but he had not
      known what love was until he met Yvette. He was bound to the other girl by
      ties he could not break, which was quite true, because the nice girl had a
      rich father. He drew such a pathetic picture of the loveless life he must
      in the future lead, that a great wave of self-pity surged up within him
      and his voice quavered. He felt almost resentful that she should take the
      separation in such an unemotional manner. When a man gets what he most
      desires he is still unsatisfied. This was exactly the way he had hoped she
      would take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things come to an end, even explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye, Yvette,&rdquo; he said, reaching out his hand. She
      hesitated an instant, then without looking up, placed her small palm in
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood thus for a moment under the trees, while the fountain beside
      them plashed and trickled musically. The shadow of the church was slowly
      creeping towards them over the gravel. The park was deserted, except by
      themselves. She tried gently to withdraw her hand, which he retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say to me, Yvette?&rdquo; he asked, with a
      touch of reproach in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. He held her fingers, which were slipping from his
      grasp, and the shadow touched her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvette, you will at least kiss me goodbye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She quickly withdrew her hand from his, shook her head and turned away. He
      watched her until she was out of sight, and then walked slowly towards his
      rooms on the Boulevard St. Germain. His thoughts were not comfortable. He
      was disappointed in Yvette. She was so clever, so witty, that he had at
      least expected she would have said something cutting, which he felt he
      thoroughly deserved. He had no idea she could be so heartless. Then his
      thoughts turned to the nice girl at home. She, too, had elements in her
      character that were somewhat bewildering to an honest young man. Her
      letters for a long time had been infrequent and unsatisfactory. It couldn&rsquo;t
      be possible that she had heard anything. Still, there is nothing so easy
      as point-blank denial, and he would see to that when he reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      An explanation awaited him at his rooms on the Boulevard. There was a
      foreign stamp on the envelope, and it was from the nice girl. There had
      been a mistake, she wrote, but happily she had discovered it before it was
      too late. She bitterly reproached herself, taking three pages to do it in,
      and on the fourth page he gathered that she would be married by the time
      he had the letter. There appeared to be no doubt that the nice girl fully
      realized how basely she had treated a talented, hard- working, aspiring,
      sterling young man, but the realization had not seemingly postponed the
      ringing of the wedding-bells to any appreciable extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young McLane crushed the letter in his hand and used strong language, as,
      indeed, he was perfectly justified in doing. He laughed a hard dry laugh
      at the perfidy of woman. Then his thoughts turned towards Yvette. What a
      pity it was she was not rich! Like so many other noble, talented men, he
      realized he could not marry a poor woman. Suddenly it occurred to him that
      Yvette might not be poor. The more he pondered over the matter the more
      astonished he was that he had ever taken her poverty for granted. She
      dressed richly, and that cost money in Paris. He remembered that she wore
      a watch which flashed with jewels on the one occasion when he had seen it
      for a moment. He wished he had postponed his explanation for one more day;
      still, that was something easily remedied. He would tell her he had thrown
      over the other girl for her sake. Like a pang there came to him the
      remembrance that he did not know her address, nor even her family name.
      Still, she would be sure to visit the little park, and he would haunt it
      until she came. The haunting would give additional point to his story of
      consuming love. Anyhow, nothing could be done that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he was overjoyed to receive a letter from Yvette, and he
      was more than pleased when he read its contents. It asked for one more
      meeting behind the church.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I could not tell you to-day,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;all I felt. To-morrow you
shall know, if you meet me. Do not fear that I will reproach you. You
will receive this letter in the morning. At twelve o&rsquo;clock I shall be
waiting for you on the sixth bench on the row south of the fountain&mdash;
the sixth bench&mdash;the farthest from the church.&rdquo;
                                                  &ldquo;YVETTE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      McLane was overjoyed at his good luck. He felt that he hardly merited it.
      He was early at the spot, and sat down on the last bench of the row facing
      the fountain. Yvette had not yet arrived, but it was still half an hour
      before the time. McLane read the morning paper and waited. At last the
      bells all around him chimed the hour of twelve. She had not come. This was
      unusual, but always possible. She might not have succeeded in getting
      away. The quarter and then the half hour passed before McLane began to
      suspect that he had been made the victim of a practical joke. He dismissed
      the thought; such a thing was so unlike her. He walked around the little
      park, hoping he had mistaken the row of benches. She was not there. He
      read the letter again. It was plain enough&mdash;the sixth bench. He
      counted the benches beginning at the church. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five.
      There were only five benches in the row.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he gazed stupidly at the fifth bench a man beside him said&mdash;&ldquo;That
      is the bench, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried McLane, turning toward him,
      astonished at the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was there that the young girl was found dead this morning&mdash;
      poisoned, they say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane stared at him&mdash;and then he said huskily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;was she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows that&mdash;yet. We will soon know, for everybody, as
      you see, is going into the Morgue. She&rsquo;s the only one on the bench
      to-day. Better go before the crowd gets greater. I have been twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane sank on the seat and drew his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew she was waiting for him on the sixth bench&mdash;the furthest from
      the church!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
